4	AARTIIND	Aarti Industries Ltd	Trade setup for Wednesday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The recovery in late trade amid consolidation helped the market close flat with a positive bias on June 6, as the three-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee members started a discussion over interest rate decisions.

The benchmark indices continued the uptrend for the third consecutive session. The BSE Sensex was up 5.4 points at 62,793, while the Nifty50 rose 5.2 points to 18,599 and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating the tug-of-war between bulls and bears for market direction as the closing was similar to opening levels.

""Normally, such Doji formations after a reasonable up move or down move calls for reversal. Having formed this pattern amidst a range movement, the predictive value of this pattern could be less,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He feels immediate supports like daily 10 and 20-day EMAs (exponential moving average) are intact and the intraday buying has been emerging so far from this support in the short term.

On the upper side, repeated testing of crucial hurdle around the 18,600-18,700 levels is expected to result in a decisive upside breakout, while immediate support is at 18,500 levels, Shetti said.

We have seen a continued uptrend in broader markets with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 0.06 percent and 0.54 percent, respectively.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

The Nifty may get support at 18,550, followed by 18,528 and 18,493. If the index advances, then 18,619 will be the key resistance followed by 18,641 and 18,676.

Nifty Bank

We have also seen an upward journey in the Bank Nifty for the third day in a row. The index climbed 63 points to 44,165 amid volatility and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale for yet another session.

""The Doji candle formation suggests that the overall trend is expected to remain sideways, without a clear direction in the index's movement,"" Rupak De, Senior Technical at LKP Securities said.

He feels the support level is identified at 44,000 and if the index falls below this level, it might drop towards 43,700. On the other hand, the resistance levels are observed at 44,300 and 44,500 acting as barriers to further upward movement, he said.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,050, followed by 43,997 and 43,910, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,223, then 44,277 and 44,363.

On the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest (OI) was at 18,600 strike, with 1.01 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty.

Stocks with high delivery percentage

A high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Larsen & Toubro, Petronet LNG, Cummins India, Coal India and United Breweries among others.

45 stocks see a long build-up

An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 45 stocks, including JK Cement, Maruti Suzuki India, ACC, Tata Communications and Syngene International saw long buildups.

5	ACC	ACC Ltd	India-Pakistan World Cup match in Ahmedabad a near certainty as ‘hybrid’ Asia Cup model set to get approval	"The 'hybrid' Asia Cup model is likely to be approved by the Asian Cricket Council, headed by BCCI secretary Jay Shah, which would see Pakistan host four of the tournament's matches, excluding India, while the remaining nine will be played in Sri Lanka.

The ACC is expected to make a formal announcement on Tuesday and once the hybrid model is officially accepted, decks will be cleared for Pakistan team's travel to India for the ODI World Cup scheduled in October-November. Now, Pakistan will have no problems playing in Ahmedabad.

""Oman Cricket board chief Pankaj Khimji, one of the respected ACC executive board members, was entrusted to find a solution as most countries didn't want a hybrid model. But as of now four non-India games -- Pakistan vs Nepal, Bangladesh vs Afghanistan, Afghanistan vs Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh -- will be held at the Gadaffi Stadium in Lahore.

""The two India vs Pakistan games and all other Super Four Games will be held in either Pallekele or Galle,"" an ACC board member told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

The 'hybrid' model was proposed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and has been met with a positive response from the other member boards of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). The ACC is expected to make a decision on the matter in the coming days.

If the 'hybrid' model is approved, it would be a major breakthrough for the PCB. It would also be a boost for the ACC, which has been looking for ways to revive the Asia Cup after it was downgraded to a tri-series in 2018.

The Asia Cup is scheduled to be held from September 17 to October 1 in Pakistan. The tournament will feature five teams – India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.

India will probably play Pakistan in Ahmedabad in the World Cup. Pakistan's remaining matches could be held in Chennai and Hyderabad.

5	ACC	ACC Ltd	ACC Likely To Go Ahead With PCB’s Hybrid Model For 2023 Asia Cup	"Asia Cup trophy. | (Credits: Twitter)

The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is likely to approve Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB)'s hybrid model for this year's Asia Cup, with Sri Lanka as the neutral venue, where India can play their games. According to media reports, Pakistan will host four or five matches, while Sri Lanka will host the India-Pakistan games, including the final if India makes it.

As per reports, the announcement will come after the weekend and the window set for the tournament is currently between September 1-17. For the Pakistan, Lahore will likely be the host. The anticipated approval breaks the deadlock, which has dragged for quite some time and has threatened the fallout of the ICC events, including the 2023 World Cup and 2025 Champions Trophy.

The hybrid model came into the picture as India and Pakistan refused to travel to each other's country. India's refusal to go to Pakistan forced Pakistan to come up with this model to retain the hosting rights. While Pakistan had initially proposed UAE as one of the hosts, Bangladesh raised concerns over the weather conditions in the Middle East in September.

Pakistan finished as runners-up in the 2022 Asia Cup:

The Men in Green were the runners-up in last year's Asia Cup, losing to Sri Lanka in the final by 23 runs at the Dubai International Stadium. India have won the trophy most times, winning seven titles, while Pakistan have won only twice.

This year's Asia Cup is likely to have 13 games in 13 days and two teams will advance to the Super 4 round, with top two playing in the final. Hence, that leaves open the possibility of India and Pakistan locking horns in the final."	"Asia Cup trophy.

9	ADANIPORTS	Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd	Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports among 21 lossmaking companies to pay dividend	"Prior approval of shareholders is mandatory if dividend is declared out of general reserves.

Despite making losses in FY23, some companies have recommended paying dividends, a matter that is subject to approval from shareholders. The promoter holding in these companies ranges from 33 percent to 75 percent, which means they will be the major beneficiaries of the dividend payments.

At least 21 companies that posted a net loss on a standalone basis in FY23 have declared dividend payments, a Moneycontrol analysis showed. Some of these companies have made a profit on a consolidated level because their subsidiaries posted positive earnings.

According to Makarand Joshi, founding partner of MMJC & Associates, a corporate compliance firm, dividends must be paid based on a company’s standalone profits

Among the lossmaking companies are Bharti Airtel, which announced a dividend of 100 percent on the face value of each Rs 5 share, and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, which declared a dividend of 250 percent on the face value of its Rs 2 share.

Sunteck Realty and Bombay Burmah Trading Corp plan to pay dividends of 150 percent and 60 percent, respectively. Other companies announced dividend payments ranging from 5 percent to 250 percent.

Airtel, Adani promoters

In absolute terms, Bharti Airtel and Adani Ports & SEZ announced a total dividend pay-out of about Rs 2,984 crore and Rs 1,080 crore, respectively.

In Bharti Airtel, the promoters hold a 55-percent stake and they will get Rs 1,642 crore. The Adani Ports & SEZ promoters, with a 61.03-percent stake, stand to receive Rs 659.16 crore as dividend.

Emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Adani Ports & SEZ remained unanswered.

Sunteck Realty and Bombay Burmah Trading announced a total dividend of Rs 22 crore and Rs 8.4 crore, and their promoters will get Rs 14.77 crore and Rs 5.52 crore, respectively.

RHI Magnesita India and Entertainment Network India have announced a total dividend of Rs 47 crore and 4.77 crore, and their promoters will get Rs 28.25 crore and Rs 3.4 crore, respectively.

Joshi said paying a dividend is a way of returning profit to the shareholders. The Companies Act allows payment of dividend from free reserves even if the company has made a loss. Such payments are subject to restrictions on the amount that can be distributed as dividend.

Companies can also pay dividends from the profit of previous years and from general reserves. If companies pay a dividend from a previous year’s profit, there is no limit on the amount.

If a dividend is paid out of general reserves, there are restrictions on the amount as well as the rate of dividend. In both cases, depreciation must be provided for and losses, if any in the current or previous years, must be adjusted before distributing dividend.

Prior approval

Prior approval of shareholders is mandatory if dividend is declared out of general reserves, but dividend out of a previous year’s profit can be declared by the board on its own as interim dividend, Joshi added.

The decision to pay dividends must be taken after considering factors including the company's expansion plans. The regulator has mandated the top 1,000 listed companies to frame a dividend distribution policy to bring certainty in dividend payments. Proxy advisors have raised concerns when there is inconsistency in dividend distribution.

""It is being seen that a dividend is declared by certain companies to provide income for cash-strapped promoters or group companies. Also, this shows inconsistency in quantum and timing of dividend. It needs to be highlighted here that excessive dividend distribution might eventually lead to erosion of net worth,"" Joshi said."	"At least 21 companies that posted a net loss on a standalone basis in FY23 have declared dividend payments, a Moneycontrol analysis showed.
Other companies announced dividend payments ranging from 5 percent to 250 percent.
Airtel, Adani promotersIn absolute terms, Bharti Airtel and Adani Ports & SEZ announced a total dividend pay-out of about Rs 2,984 crore and Rs 1,080 crore, respectively.
The Adani Ports & SEZ promoters, with a 61.03-percent stake, stand to receive Rs 659.16 crore as dividend.

9	ADANIPORTS	Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd	Adani Ports, Adani Green, Adani Transmission: Adani shares in focus amid report of $2 billion fundraising plan	"Shares of three Adani group companies namely Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission and Adani Ports & SEZ are in focus on Thursday morning after a media report quoting sources suggested that the group may revisit global bond markets by September to raise up to $2 billion via sustainability-linked and green bonds.

In May, a Bloomberg report suggested that Adani Green Energy, Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises could raise between $3 billion and $5 billion, citing people familiar with the matter. Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Co, which invested almost $2 billion in Adani companies, did not plan to take part in any potential share or bond sales, IHC's spokesperson Ahmed Ibrahim had told Reuters in May.

Adani group has been in news of late as the group announced completion of its prepayment programme, aggregating $2.65 billion. The group had went on deleveraging drive in an attempt to win back investor trust post a scathing report by the US short seller Hindenburg Research.

The group said its combined net debt-to-Ebitda ratio decreased from 3.81 in FY22 to 3.27 in FY23 and run rate Ebitda surged from Rs 50,706 crore in FY22 to Rs 66,566 crore in FY23. Cash balance at listed portfolio is now up 41.5 per cent at $4.75 billion, or Rs 40,351 crore, said the conglomerate as part of its credit update for FY23.

The group achieved a key milestone in its $300-million foreign currency sustainability-linked bonds raised by Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd (AEML) in 2021. AEML, which is Adani Transmission Ltd's distribution arm, raised the bonds as part of its $2-billion global medium-term notes program, ET reported.

10	ABB	ABB India Ltd	ABB India shares at Rs 5,000? UBS upgrades stock to ‘Buy’. Here’s why	"Foreign brokerage UBS has upgraded ABB India shares to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' earlier, with a revised target of Rs 5,000 against Rs 3,770, suggesting a 21 per cent upside over June 9's closing value of Rs 4,148.90. Short-cycle demand for ABB's industrial products has been stronger than expected on the back of its deeper geographical penetration, UBS said.

Electrification and motion are set to lift margins even though ABB remains dependent on imports in process automation and robotics, it said adding that ABB India's Indian leadership is highly focused on expanding market opportunities, especially in low voltage electrification.

""While consensus margin forecasts have risen 120 bps in the past 12 months, we think ABB's true potential from value-accretive electrification and motion has yet to be priced in. A growing contribution from highly scalable new segments and products aid growth and OPM, supported by active capex,"" it said.

UBS said it remains bullish on industrial automation and low voltage electrification demand and sees an improving case for further operating profit margin growth.

""We lift margins by 130 bps and earnings by 10-17 per cent for CY23-25E, which we believe realistically reflects the sustainability of margins, driven by volume and revenue mix benefits from electrification and motion. Our CY24/25E earnings forecasts are 10 per cent/15 per cent ahead of consensus. We raise our price target from Rs 3,770 to Rs5,000, and upgrade the stock to Buy, based on a peak PE of 70 times (vs the 62 times earlier), pricing in the potential for greater growth-led capex,"" it said.

UBS' order of preferences in the industrial sector coverage is now Siemens, ABB India, Larsen & Toubro and BHEL.

With wide innovation-driven moats and high value-added products, ABB is extending its geographical reach in its leadership segments, such as motors, drives, low and medium voltage switches, and switchgears, which in UBS said have a lot more room to grow profitably.

Further momentum in service-layered long-term projects points to medium-to long-term growth in revenue share from high margin services, it said.

10	ABB	ABB India Ltd	Chakri Lokapriya on why Tata Motors stock is headed much higher from current levels	"""The stock is headed much higher from the current levels. They were one of the first companies, one of the large companies to announce a proper EV pipeline across various price points,"" says Chakri Lokapriya , CIO & MD, TCG AMC The stock is headed much higher from the current levels. They were one of the first companies, one of the large companies to announce a proper EV pipeline across various price points. Second, their traditional businesses have picked up. Third, their debt has come down. And now leading into their analyst meet sometime next week where we will see further details on this roadmap. So I think now you will value the company much higher because the debt profile is far better than it was before. So from that perspective, I think an easy 25% higher from current levels than a year from now.Indeed, these are one of those enigmatic stocks because valuation is always on their side. I think there are two things markets are expecting. One, there may be a sharp oil price hike. I mean, oil prices globally may go up in which case the margins go down for these companies or two, the prices the companies are required to cut petrol and diesel prices at the petrol station as we run into elections that is the other risk. So one of these two can happen but that is probably what is holding back these stocks.I think ABB will continue to do well because this company despite its high valuation has a very strong product portfolio, access to its parent product portfolio and companies which are high PE, which are able to deliver on growth continue to remain high PE for extended periods of time.So ABB looks good. On the other hand, Voltas has been facing tough competition in the air conditioning space, thereis no pricing power, all the companies are trying to take market share. Concor I think, yes, because disinvestment is a kind of unknown when it will happen but valuations are on your side.In the case of Bharti I think the big expectation is they will take market share. Now whether they are in two player market in a sense, you know, one taking market share from the other is not really the story I think, because it is just an expanding market share with 5G as and when that happens.So more importantly, the stock has done well but still they are not able to get their ARPUs at a desired level of ARPUs. So I think it has done well, so I would not really chase it at this point."	"""The stock is headed much higher from the current levels.

12	ADANIPOWER	Adani Power Ltd	Power plants using imported coal to operate at full capacity till September	"

Many power plants in India, including those owned by Adani Power and Tata Power use imported coal, but were not operating at full capacity, adding to challenges for the country in meeting its power demand amid an ongoing heat wave.

India on Monday said power plants operating on imported coal would have to run at full capacity till the end of September, extending an earlier timeline by over three months, according to a government order seen by Reuters.



India initially said in February these plants were to operate at full capacity till June 15, as the government looked to maximise output ahead of an expected record surge in power usage during the summer.

Various places in India have been reeling under severe heat over the last few weeks, with maximum temperatures hitting 42-44 degrees Celsius over parts of Central, Northwest, East, and North India on Saturday.



The order has been sent to JSW Ratnagiri Ltd., Essar Power Gujarat Ltd and 13 other factories totalling a capacity of 17 gigawatts.

""It has now been decided to extend the time period for... directive to imported coal-based generators, up to September 30,"" the order issued by the Ministry of Power on Monday states.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

Eleven non-F&O stocks are likely to be removed from the Nifty Next 50 index, if the exchange decides to tweak its computation methodology, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.

These 11 stocks are Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, Bajaj Holdings, Adani Green Energy, Zomato, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, P&G Hygiene, LIC and Adani Wilmar.

Currently, these 11 stocks command 9.05 percent weight in the Nifty Next 50 index. Nifty Next 50 represents the next rung of liquid securities after the Nifty 50.

""The exposure of the index to non-F&O stocks frequently hitting the price bands, lowers the ability to replicate the index portfolio efficiently and thus increases the tracking error,"" according to Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

To resolve this, NSE Indices has floated a discussion paper and proposed that only stocks traded in the futures and options (F&O) segment be part of the index.

""Having only those stocks that are available for F&O trading into the Nifty Next 50 index shall improve the ease of replication of the index by passive funds,"" Pagaria said.

This could be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be implemented on June 30, these 11 stocks will see a reduction in their weight. From 9.05 percent, the cumulative weight for the non F&O stocks will come down to 5 percent.

In the second phase, to be implemented on September 30, the stocks will be deleted and a new set will be added.

""As of now, this is just a consultation and final implementation could be announced by exchange by third week of June,"" added Pagaria.

In the case of deletion, the 11 stocks that stand to get entry to Nifty Next 50 are Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent, Indian Hotels, TVS Motor Company, Cummins India, Jindal Steel and Power, Polycab, Punjab National Bank, Zydus Lifesciences and Abbott India.

Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent and Indian Hotels could see over $40 million of inflow due to this, according to Nuvama's calculations. These changes are key to tracking as many exchange-traded funds and index funds are benchmarked to it.

19	AMARAJABAT	Amara Raja Batteries Ltd	Amara Raja Batteries (ARBL) Stock: A Value Pick with Growth Potential	"The Nifty auto index is touching all-time highs and the Nifty has also rebounded close to its peak seen in December 2022. However, there are still some pockets of opportunity left in the markets. The stock of Amara Raja Batteries (ARBL) is one such. At ₹625 now, it is at a 44.5 per cent discount to its all-time high touched in 2015. At 15 times trailing 12-month earnings, it is much cheaper than peer Exide Industries trading at about 20 times. ARBL has corrected since December 2022, where it touched one-year high of ₹668 alongside the broader market peak.

The electric vehicle (EV) narrative has been a big dampener for battery makers in the last few years as their core product, i.e. lead acid batteries for vehicles, will be replaced by lithium ion ones in EVs.

EV sales too have caught on in a big way since the pandemic, with FY23 seeing a 157 per cent growth in sale of registered EVs to about 11.8 lakh units. ARBL’s failure to qualify for PLI for the manufacture of ACC batteries has been another negative. However, the fear may be overdone. For one, EV sales constitute just 5.5 per cent of the conventional vehicle sales in FY23 and the path to reduce vehicular emissions is also surrounded by policy uncertainties.

Secondly, battery makers are not dependent on new vehicle sales alone as there is a recurring replacement demand for batteries from existing vehicles. Thus, the existing population of on road vehicle needs to be serviced till end of life, even if some of the incremental new vehicle sales move to EVs. Three, ARBL is also investing in manufacturing lithium batteries with an initial 2Gwh cell capacity and 2Gwh pack capacity expected by FY25 and a peak cell capacity of 16Gwh expected by FY32. Four, industrial batteries (30 per cent of revenues) provide the needed diversification from the cyclical auto industry. In this segment, ARBL has a 60 per cent market share in telecom batteries, where volumes are being supported by the 5G rollout.

Considering these factors, investors with an appetite for risk and a long-term perspective can buy the shares.

Game plan

Currently, ARBL derives almost two-thirds of its revenues from automotive batteries (lead acid) and in that, predominantly from four-wheelers and the replacement markets (see chart). After two years of double-digit growth each, SIAM, the industry body, expects growth in new car sales volumes to moderate to 5-7 per cent year-on-year in FY24. However, robust new car sales in the last 2-3 years imply that the replacement demand for these vehicles would hold the fort for ARBL in the near to medium term, when cyclicality in new vehicle kicks in. Usually, companies also have good margins in the replacement segment. While sale to OEMs will moderate, the company still expects it to be in high single digits.

What holds promise for ARBL for the long term is its new energy business. In FY23, about ₹250 crore of revenues came from sale of packs and chargers under this business, predominantly to three-wheelers and the telecom segment. This business fetches 3-4 per cent EBIDTA margins now and the company is aiming to touch ₹750 crore revenues in FY24, having roped in two-wheeler OEMs for commercial supplies recently. For perspective, two-wheelers are the largest selling EVs in the country, constituting about 60 per cent of the total EV sales today. While there are some headwinds to electric 2-wheeler sales today from the subsidy cuts by the government, adoption is still expected to be faster here than other segments.

ARBL will hold the new energy business through 100 per cent subsidiaries. Amara Raja Advanced Cell Technologies will hold the upcoming Lithium battery capacities at Divitipally in Telangana and the battery packs. Amara Raja Power Systems, which manufactures chargers, was held by promoters and ARBL acquired it recently for a cash consideration of ₹133 crore. The company had ₹184 crore of revenues, EBITDA Margin of 11.12 per cent and PBT margin of 17.4 per cent in FY23. For lithium cell technology, in-house R&D as well as investments made in a few tech companies such as Log 9 are expected to provide support. Homologation process with customers is on the anvil. On the raw material side, a 25 per cent domestic value addition is expected initially. For these plans, a total of ₹1,300 crore capex is estimated over the next 2-2.5 years and will be financed with internal accruals as well as some leverage on ARBL. The debt-to-equity ratio for ARBL is now at a comfortable 0.03.

Financials

ARBL has seen double-digit sales and profit growth in the last few quarters, with reported profits in the latest quarter growing by 40 per cent year-on-year to ₹138 crore ( adjusted profits grew by 74 per cent to ₹171 crore). Sales in Q4 grew by 11.4 per cent to ₹2,429 crore. Operating margins compressed to 9.9 per cent in Q1, following the shooting up of lead prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. While margins expanded to 13 and 15 per cent respectively in Q2 and Q3, it has again compressed a bit to 11.9 per cent in Q4, with lead prices hardening. The company expects lead prices to stabilise around the current $2,000 per tonne levels.

In September 2022, the company announced a backward integration plan with respect to plastic component for batteries, which would result in margin expansion of 75 to 100 bps for ARBL. That said, as the new energy business begins scaling up, margin pressures at the consolidated level could come into the picture until these operations achieve economies of scale.

22	APOLLOTYRE	Apollo Tyres Limited	Uno Minda, Endurance Tech, Apollo Tyres shares: Auto ancillary stocks that Elara likes	"Elara Securities, which analysed 56 listed auto ancillary companies post FY23 results, said improving operations with normalising production in H2FY23 led to better working capital, though partly offset by the rise in overall capex, leading to positive free cash flown (FCF) generation for the sector. In a sectoral note, it said 50 of 56 auto ancillary companies that it analysed posted positive FCF in FY23, led by Samvardhana Motherson International (SAMIL), Apollo Tyres and Tube Investments. The brokerage sees up to 33 per cent potential upside on the counters, based on June 8’s closing prices.

It noted that cumulative fee cash flow (FCF) for the sector in FY23 jumped to Rs 11,200 crore against a negative FCF of Rs 3,060 crore in FY22, as the domestic brokerage picked SAMIL, Uno Minda, Endurance Tech and Apollo Tyres as it preferred picks in the sector. The brokerage has price targets that suggest up to 33 per cent upside on these four stocks.

""Within the auto ancillary space, our top picks are SAMIL (SMP turnaround; product portfolio beneficiary of mega trends), Uno Minda (rising content per vehicle; benefits from mega trends in LACE effect), Endurance Tech (revival of 2W) and Apollo Tyres (margin expansion),"" it said.

Here’s what Elara said on the sector companies:

Revenue growth

Elara said among the 56 companies, top five firms in terms of Q4 revenue growth stood at Craftsman Automation (up 49 per cent YoY), Swaraj Engines (up 49 per cent YoY), Suprajit Engineering (up 38 per cent YoY), Sona BLW Forgings (up 35 per cent YoY) and SAMIL (up 31 per cent) YoY.

Ebitda growth

Minda Uno was among top-five companies in terms of Ebitda growth at 57 per cent. Automotive Axles (up 91 per cent YoY), ZF CV Systems (up 86 per cent YoY), Lumax Industries (up 54 per cent YoY) and Varroc Engineering (up 52 per cent YoY) were other companies reporting solid Ebitda growth in FY23.

Auto ancillaries with over 40 per cent exposure to two-wheelers and with less risk from EV disruption from product portfolio perspective included Gabriel India, Endurance Tech, Uno Minda, Minda Corp, Suprajit Engineering, Fiem Industries, Pricol, Sandhar Tech, TVS Srichakra, it said.

Capex spend

""We have analysed FY23 and Q4FY23 results of 56 listed auto ancillary players to assess their performance. Even as capex spend at 5.4 per cent of overall FY23 revenues was lower than 6 per cent in FY22 (eight-year average of 6.8 per cent), absolute capex spend was the highest since FY19 at Rs 19,800 crore, up 11 per cent YoY. FCF generation improved on working capital improvement due to easing supply chain challenge,' Elara said.

ROE leaders

Ancillaries that have an eight-year median ROE of 14.7 per cent or higher and P/BV of 4.5 times or lower, are SAMIL, Amara Raja, Minda Corporation, Gabriel, LG Balakrishnan, MM Forgings, Lumax Industries, NRB Bearings, GNA Axles and Talbros."

22	APOLLOTYRE	Apollo Tyres Limited	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"Trading

With the Nifty50 falling below the 18,600 mark on June 9, we saw selling pressure in equity benchmarks for yet another session as all sectors trended down, led by FMCG and IT.

The BSE Sensex dropped 223 points to 62,626, while the Nifty50 declined 71 points to 18,563, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts for the second straight session.

Overall, the Nifty is not displaying any major signs of weakness. However, ""at higher levels, signs of exhaustion are emerging, with negative divergence observed in momentum indicators, suggesting a potential for profit booking in the market,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

He feels the immediate and crucial support level stands at the 20-day moving average (DMA) of 18,450, and if breached, the next support level would be 18,180. On the upside, the 18,800-18,888 range is seen to be a resistance zone, he said.

Broader markets also trended downward, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling over one-tenth of a percent each on weak breadth, even as volatility remained lower levels. The India VIX closed at a one-and-half-month low (11.12), indicating that the market is more stable.

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels in the later part of the session and ended the day 6.3 points down at 43,989, forming a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale.

""We expect the prices to oscillate within a broad horizontal range of 43,500-44,500. Currently, the index is trading above the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average), which aligns near 43,850. A significant breach below this EMA level would strengthen the possibility of further decline towards 43,500,"" said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President at Master Capital Services.

Meanwhile, here's what brokerages recommend for Ikio Lighting IPO:

Since Signify is the company's largest customer, analysts warn that the former's market-share loss could curtail the latter’s offtake. That apart, delay in continuous customer on-boarding could curb growth prospects.

Anand Rathi | Subscribe Analysts believe that the company's ability to offer end-to-end solutions and its backward-integrated manufacturing have resulted in a strong business model with healthy RoEs despite operating on a smaller base than its peers, which cater mainly to the mass-market needs of leading brands. They said that the stock trades at 54x 9MFY23 earnings-per-share (EPS) of Rs 5.3 at the upper price band.



ICICI Securities | Unrated The brokerage firm said that at the upper price band of Rs 285, the stock is priced at 32x FY23 annualised EPS of Rs 8.8/share. While analysts highlighted government incentives, China +1 strategy to drive the growth of LED lighting EMS (electronic manufacturing service) industry; the company's dependency on single product category and high dependency on imports for supply of raw materials can act as key risks.



Choice Equity | Subscribe Analysts assert that the company's peers operating in the EMS sector does not have similar business operations to it, and are considered only for valuation benchmarking. Ikio is demanding a P/E multiple of 43.6x (to its restated FY22 EPS of Rs. 6.5), compared to the peer average of 94.6x, they said. Based on FY23E earnings, the demanded P/E of 32.7x is at discount to peer’s prevailing trailing twelve months P/E multiple of 43.2x.

24	AMBUJACEM	Ambuja Cements Ltd	Ambuja Cements, ACC withdraw membership from CMA	"With the overhang of a hefty penalty by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on alleged cartelisation, Adani Group companies, Ambuja Cements and ACC, have withdrawn their membership from the Cement Manufacturers’ Association.

The development comes when the Adani group is still attempting to battle out allegations levelled by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research.

Lowering penalty

The group has deleveraged the balance sheet by repaying $2.65 billion and the last thing it wants now is to fight a case on price cartelisation in the cement business, sources said. Last September, Adani Group had acquired both Ambuja Cements and its subsidiary ACC through a deal worth $6.4 billion to become the country’s second largest cement maker.

Also read: Inox Wind faces blacklist as Central Electricity Authority threatens action on Adani Group complaints

The withdrawal of CMA membership will also provide an opportunity for Adani group companies to plead for lowering the penalty, though the Supreme Court will take the final call, said the source. While the Adani group took over the liabilities including the CCI penalty, it was not the owner of the firms when the alleged cartelisation charges were levied.

A recap

In August 2016, the CCI had slapped about ₹6,300 crore in penalties on 11 cement companies for indulging in price cartelisation.

The penalty on Ambuja Cement and ACC was about ₹1,164 crore and ₹1,148 crore, respectively. The industry body, CMA, was fined ₹73 lakh. The CCI had also directed all the firms to “cease and desist” from indulging in any activity relating to agreement, understanding or arrangement on prices, production and supply of cement in the market.

Following this, cement companies challenged the penalty at the Competition Appellate Tribunal and it was stayed with a clause to shell out 10 per cent of the penalty. Later, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (earlier Competition Appellate Tribunal) dismissed the cement makers’ plea, following which they moved the Supreme Court.

In 2018, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton Nariman stayed the NCLAT order and directed the affected cement companies and industry body to deposit 10 per cent of the penalty."

The stock of Ambuja Cements jumped 4.54 per cent, ACC rallied 2.47 per cent, Adani Power gained 1.37 per cent, Adani Ports advanced 0.89 per cent and Adani Green Energy climbed 0.51 per cent on the BSE.

However, shares of Adani Transmission fell 1.55 per cent, NDTV went lower by 0.96 per cent, Adani Wilmar dropped 0.60 per cent, Adani Total Gas declined 0.45 per cent and Adani Enterprises dipped 0.01 per cent.

In the equity market, the BSE benchmark ended flat in a volatile trade, marginally up by 5.41 points or 0.01 per cent at 62,792.88.

Embattled Adani Group on Monday said it has repaid loans aggregating USD 2.65 billion to complete a prepayment programme to cut overall leverage in an attempt to win back investor trust post a damning report of a US short seller.

In a Credit Note released on Monday, Adani Group said it has made a full prepayment of USD 2.15 billion of loans that were taken by pledging shares in the conglomerate's listed firms and also another USD 700 million in loans taken for the acquisition of Ambuja Cement.

""The prepayment was done along with interest payment of USD 203 million,"" it added.

Further, the credit update states that the promoters completed the sale of shares in four listed group entities to GQG Partners, a leading global investment firm, for USD 1.87 billion (Rs 15,446 crore).

Eleven non-F&O stocks are likely to be removed from the Nifty Next 50 index, if the exchange decides to tweak its computation methodology, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.

These 11 stocks are Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, Bajaj Holdings, Adani Green Energy, Zomato, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, P&G Hygiene, LIC and Adani Wilmar.

Currently, these 11 stocks command 9.05 percent weight in the Nifty Next 50 index. Nifty Next 50 represents the next rung of liquid securities after the Nifty 50.

""The exposure of the index to non-F&O stocks frequently hitting the price bands, lowers the ability to replicate the index portfolio efficiently and thus increases the tracking error,"" according to Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

Follow our live blog for all the market action

To resolve this, NSE Indices has floated a discussion paper and proposed that only stocks traded in the futures and options (F&O) segment be part of the index.

""Having only those stocks that are available for F&O trading into the Nifty Next 50 index shall improve the ease of replication of the index by passive funds,"" Pagaria said.

This could be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be implemented on June 30, these 11 stocks will see a reduction in their weight. From 9.05 percent, the cumulative weight for the non F&O stocks will come down to 5 percent.

In the second phase, to be implemented on September 30, the stocks will be deleted and a new set will be added.

""As of now, this is just a consultation and final implementation could be announced by exchange by third week of June,"" added Pagaria.

In the case of deletion, the 11 stocks that stand to get entry to Nifty Next 50 are Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent, Indian Hotels, TVS Motor Company, Cummins India, Jindal Steel and Power, Polycab, Punjab National Bank, Zydus Lifesciences and Abbott India.

Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent and Indian Hotels could see over $40 million of inflow due to this, according to Nuvama's calculations. These changes are key to tracking as many exchange-traded funds and index funds are benchmarked to it.

Sanjiv Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Finserv Ltd, the holding company of the group, said mobile phone users would soon have the right to be forgotten by Bajaj Finance.

""You will see in three months' time, on our website and our app, an option -- you click it and we will never bother you again. You'll have the right to be forgotten with us but then make sure, you never come back to us for our products and solutions,"" Bajaj said on telemarketing calls used to push loans.

Bajaj's comment comes at a time when Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has asked telcos to take immediate actions to curb the menace of unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) that, at times, leads to instances of frauds and scams.

According to Bajaj, loans solicited through “push calls” account for less than 15 per cent of the NBFC's business and the aim is to bring it down to less than 10 per cent and then even lower the organisation gets more digital.

“The aim would ideally be getting that 15 per cent down to 10 per cent or take it down to zero so that our calls would only be service calls. All promotional activities will happen through our digital channels. That is the aim we want to get to,” he said.

44	BATAINDIA	Bata India Ltd	Tata Consumer, Bata, M&M Finance, HUL: stocks to buy ahead of Monsoon this year	"Monsoon is round the corner and with the El-Nino effect, the rainy season is a bit delayed to enter India. However, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the monsoon is very close to the southern tip and it will hit India in another 2-3 days.



India is an agriculture-driven country, whose about 60 per cent population is dependent on the primary sector. Monsoon is one of the major factors, which drives the Indian economy. Thus, monsoon is a major factor that impacts the performance of Indian equity markets.



The monsoon usually begins in June and drives rural consumption. However, if India faces lesser-than normal rains or drought, it would be a double whammy for the domestic economy. It will not only impact rural consumption but also means that summers and heat will last longer in the major parts of the country.



IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year, 96 per cent of long period average (LPA) with its arrival was expected by June 4, 2023 in Kerala. Onset of monsoon should be good for agriculture and important to drive the rural demand which will benefit sectors like agrochemicals, fertilizers and rural consumption stocks, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services.



The brokerage picked up M&M Finance, Tata Consumer Products, Finolex Pipes, Coromandel International and Bata India for aggressive traders for next 1-2 months with an upside potential of up to 12 per cent and traders can keep a stop loss of 6 per cent. ""We have given equal weightage to all the 5 stocks at 20 per cent each as we feel all the stocks should benefit equally due to the monsoon,"" it said.



Not only the economy, a number of sectors and stocks including cement, agrochemicals, fertilizers, FMCG, and tractor players are directly related to these events. Consumer companies with higher rural salience are also likely to be at focus as the onset of monsoon progresses.



Another brokerage firm, KR Choksey has suggested picking Balkrishna Industries and Hindustan Unilever (HUL) from the segment with an upside potential of up to 15 per cent.



""Overall rural FMCG consumption returned to growth after 6 quarters of decline. Rural sales form 40 per cent of HUL’s total revenue. Any improvement in rural India will strongly benefit HUL. The macro environment is easing which will lead to rural growth coming back. India’s CPI inflation declined to CPI to 4.7 per cent in April 2023,"" it said with a buy rating on HUL.



Balkrishna Industries is engaged in the manufacture of safe, innovative and performance focused tires for over 30 years. Its tires cater to a range of specialist sectors, such as agriculture, construction, earthmoving, port and mining industries. It has a global customer base with distribution partners in over 160 countries on five continents, said KR Choksey with an 'accumulate' rating.



El Nino's triggering sub-par rains or deficit rain does not bode well for the Indian equity markets. However, India has come a long way to reduce its over dependence on the agrarian sector, but analysts believe that near-normal monsoon will be a good sign for the economy, particularly ahead of general elections next year.



The equity market continues to be attractive despite rich relative valuations largely due to strong earnings growth prospects and a swelling bid from both domestic and foreign investors, said Ridham Desai , Managing Director at Morgan Stanley India.



However, he has cited slower global growth, tight global liquidity, weather vagaries and their impact on farm output, potential worsening of state fiscal position and a resurgence in commodity prices as the key risks for the domestic equities. ""The most important catalyst in 2H2023is the market’s view on the 2024 general election outcome,"" he said.

47	BALRAMCHIN	Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"Trading

With the Nifty50 falling below the 18,600 mark on June 9, we saw selling pressure in equity benchmarks for yet another session as all sectors trended down, led by FMCG and IT.

The BSE Sensex dropped 223 points to 62,626, while the Nifty50 declined 71 points to 18,563, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts for the second straight session.

Overall, the Nifty is not displaying any major signs of weakness. However, ""at higher levels, signs of exhaustion are emerging, with negative divergence observed in momentum indicators, suggesting a potential for profit booking in the market,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

He feels the immediate and crucial support level stands at the 20-day moving average (DMA) of 18,450, and if breached, the next support level would be 18,180. On the upside, the 18,800-18,888 range is seen to be a resistance zone, he said.

Broader markets also trended downward, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling over one-tenth of a percent each on weak breadth, even as volatility remained lower levels. The India VIX closed at a one-and-half-month low (11.12), indicating that the market is more stable.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels in the later part of the session and ended the day 6.3 points down at 43,989, forming a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale.

""We expect the prices to oscillate within a broad horizontal range of 43,500-44,500. Currently, the index is trading above the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average), which aligns near 43,850. A significant breach below this EMA level would strengthen the possibility of further decline towards 43,500,"" said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President at Master Capital Services.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to find support at 43,937, followed by 43,870 and 43,760, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,157, then 44,225 and 44,335.

50	BANKINDIA	Bank of India Ltd	RBI permits banks to undertake compromise settlement of wilful defaults, fraud accounts	"June 12, 2023 04:56 pm | Updated 04:56 pm IST - Mumbai

In order to ensure maximum recovery from distressed assets, the Reserve Bank of India has allowed banks to go for compromise settlement of fraud accounts and wilful defaults.

All regulated entities (REs) will be required to put in place board-approved policies for undertaking compromise settlements, with the borrowers as well as for technical write-offs laying down the process to be followed for all compromise settlements and technical write-offs, with specific guidance on the necessary conditions precedent, the RBI has said in a notification.

Conditions would include minimum ageing, deterioration in collateral value etc., it said.

The policies would also put in place a graded framework for the examination of staff accountability in such cases with reasonable thresholds and timelines as may be decided by the board.

REs may undertake compromise settlements or technical write-offs in respect of accounts categorised as wilful defaulters or fraud without prejudice to the criminal proceeding underway against such debtors.

""In respect of compromise settlements, the policy shall inter alia contain provisions relating to permissible sacrifice for various categories of exposures while arriving at the settlement amount, after prudently reckoning the current realisable value of security/collateral, where available,"" as per the notification.

The methodology for arriving at the realisable value of the security shall also form part of the policy.

The objective would be to maximise the possible recovery from a distressed borrower at minimum expense, in the best interest of the Regulated Entity (RE).

""The compromise settlements and technical write-offs would be without prejudice to any mutually agreed contractual provisions between the RE and the borrower relating to future contingent realisations or recovery by the RE, subject to such claims not being recognised in any manner on the balance sheet of REs at the time of the settlement or subsequently till actual realisation of such receivables,"" it said.

Any such claims recognised on the balance sheet of the RE would render the arrangement to be treated as restructured as per the extant guidelines, it added.

In respect of borrowers subject to compromise settlements, the notification said, there would be a cooling period as determined by the respective board-approved policies before the REs can assume fresh exposures to such borrowers.

The cooling period in respect of exposures other than farm credit exposures would be subject to a floor of 12 months.

However, it said, REs are free to stipulate higher cooling periods in terms of their Board approved policies. The cooling period for farm credit exposures would be determined by the REs as per their respective Board approved policies."

51	BANKBARODA	Bank of Baroda Ltd	Bank of Baroda among top 5 stock ideas for next week: Swapnil Shah	Nifty faces an immediate hurdle in the zone of 18,810-18,750 ahead of the all-time pivotal resistance at 18,777. The resistance zone formerly marked exhaustion ahead of the prior declining trend. The current move has been arrested near the resistance zone and formed a bearish harami candle pattern coupled with the RSI on the daily timeframe diverging against the price, and the midcap and smallcaps cooling off after peaking in the overbought zone. This indicates an intermediate top formation. The primary trend remains healthy, however, considering the stupendous rise from the March lows, the index is anticipated to take a breather and garner further bullish strength with crucial support near 18,450 before it resumes its up move towards 19,000 and 19,200.Following the recent run in midcap IT stocks, the overall sector has come under pressure after the US software solutions company, EPAM Systems, announced a reduction in its second quarter and full-year outlook due to further deterioration in the near-term demand environment. With the IT sector embroiled in a storm currently due to the deteriorating global economic outlook, we would advise investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for at least 1-2 quarters before committing to the sector.The weekly price action faced rejection from the previous life high of 44,150 levels in succession. This has resulted in the formation of a long upper wick and the index remains jittery ahead of the US FOMC meeting scheduled in the week to come. Also looking at the options data, we reckon investors to deploy the strategy of bear put spread. The strategy would include buying a lot of 44,100 PE and simultaneously selling 43,500 PE in equal quantity. Based on the strategy, the maximum profit will be bagged on a close below 43,500 levels.From a 12-18 months perspective, we expect the company to do well on the back of multiple company and industry-specific tailwinds. The reduction in Suzlon’s debt, continued traction in its OMS (Operations and Maintenance Services) business and the latest cumulative orders of 1,542 MW which are the highest since 2019 are some of the big positives for the company. We believe that the company’s focus on higher value and higher margin business along with capabilities to execute the same should reflect in the financial performance going forward. Moreover, a strong wind projects bid pipeline of about 10 GW in FY24 and some specific government measures relating to bidding bode well for the company.We anticipate a long opportunity in Bank of Baroda on the back of steady strength in the stock and trend in sectoral price action. The stock has been trading in replica to the sectoral index. The ongoing up-leg comes on the dearth of volumes, volatility at lower levels and tighter compression in price. This further confirms limited supply and less probability of any unruly moves considering the market conditions. We anticipate a potential 10.5% on the upside for the target of Rs 204 and sell stop at Rs 176.The stock has rallied 369% from its all-time low of Rs 37 levels. It underwent an 89-week long gestation period which indicates modest accumulation, fuelling further upside. The prior trend has shown its ability to rise in price and indicates buying interest in the stock. It formed a Darvas box on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 after breaking out which is anticipated as another base of accumulation. It has potentially pierced above the Darvas ceiling and thus the brokerage reckons a buy on the stock. The stock has the potential to run-up to the levels of Rs 187 with support at Rs 161.The price action took a breather as it corrected 35% from the all-time highs after surging 556% from the all-time lows of 605. This limited correction followed by a sideway trend indicates that the potential investors in the stock hold the strength and are keen on further accumulation. This supply suction on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 adds to garnering of further strength and hence the stock is anticipated to offer long opportunities for the target of Rs 3,620. The sell limit can be placed at Rs 2,987.The pattern analysis on the daily timeframe shows that the price action is showing volatility contraction. It has been trading sideways in the last 24 weeks however with elevated swing lows. The swing lows come with time and price correction which indicates professionals’ accumulating available supply whilst the sugar stock trades at a hair’s breadth from the all-time highs. We thus anticipate a potential upside till the levels of Rs 130 with stop loss at Rs 109.The pattern analysis on the weekly chart shows the price action has staged a bullish breakout from the cup and handles schematic on a buoyant volume note. The move in the previous week came on increasing volume trend and improving relative performance compared to Nifty which manifests strength in the trend and validates the breakout further. We, thus, anticipate the price action to continue in the direction of the breakout. The target on the upside comes at Rs 1,700 and stop loss at Rs 1,378.

53	BCG	Brightcom Group Ltd	Brightcom Group shares continue to climb after turning multibagger, up 156% from one-year low; here’s why	"Shares of Brightcom Group Ltd on Friday extended their winning run for the fourth straight session. The stock jumped 5 per cent to close at the upper circuit of Rs 23.77 over its previous close of Rs 22.64. The scrip reclaimed the multibagger tag in the last trading session of May this year. At today's closing price, Brightcom has rebounded 156.42 per cent from its one-year low of Rs 9.27, a level seen on April 28, 2023, when it turned into a penny stock. In June, the counter has settled higher in six out of seven sessions so far. That said, Brightcom has gained 82.57 per cent in the past one month. Yet, it has declined 56.66 per cent in a year and 18.46 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.

This month's fresh upward move in the share price came after the company issued a lengthy clarification on its accounting procedures, reporting, corporate governance, and other issues. For the unversed, Brightcom is under the scanner of market regulator SEBI over concerns of irregular and incorrect filing of shareholding pattern.

In an exchange filing, the company said, ""The books of accounts of significant subsidiaries have been audited by reputable audit firms like EY. The audited financial statements of the subsidiaries are now available on our website.""

On asset impairment, Brightcom said, ""The total impairment impact of Rs 868.30 crore was recognised across 10 subsidiaries as per the local laws in their respective countries/jurisdictions. It was not expected to impact the parent company's profit and loss account directly. Our accounting treatment aligns with all local laws and Ind AS 36, and the impairment losses are recognized as per the accounting standards.""

The company also threw some light on the issue of payment defaults to Axis Bank and tax dues despite being cash-rich. ""The loan recall issue stemmed from the third-party collateral owners, who withdrew their support, leading us to close the loans. We closed these loans by March 2021. We are proud to share that we have been a debt-free company since then. Our priority has always been to continue investing and maintain momentum. This approach has allowed us to seize opportunities in the market, resulting in a substantial increase of approximately 76 per cent in revenues for the FY ending March 31, 2022, amounting to Rs 5,019 crore,"" Brightcom stated.

We are actively refining our reporting to ensure greater clarity and granularity to the accounting principles, it further said.

Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory at Angel One, said, ""Brightcom Group has witnessed a roller-coaster ride over the past year, with the stock at a point of time, losing almost 90 per cent of its value, to currently trade around Rs 23 levels, which is a 100 per cent plus pullback from its lows in April 2023. Certain concerns with regard to financial reporting and accounting led to this massive decline in share price. But after the company clarified that it was taking remedial measures to better its financial disclosures, there has been a respite. Investors are well advised to tread cautiously, given the overall performance of the stock in recent times.""

Bourses BSE and NSE have put the securities of Brightcom Group under the long-term ASM (Additional Surveillance Measure) framework. The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, close-to-close price variation, average daily volume in a month and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Exchanges put stocks in short-term or long-term ASM frameworks to caution investors about high volatility in share prices.

The scrip, which is backed by seasoned investor Shankar Sharma, has zoomed 1,065.20 per cent in the past five years. As of March 2023, Sharma owns a 1.24 per cent stake in the company.

On the technical front, support on the counter could be seen at Rs 20.50.

Vaishali Parekh, Vice-President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, ""The stock pattern looks erratic. It is mostly one of the operator-driven type stock. The 200-daily moving average is at around Rs 27.80 levels while the 50-EMA (Exponential Moving Average) level is at Rs 15.30 which one can note for important levels.""

Ravi Singh, Vice-President and Head of Research at Share India, said, ""The company delivered strong Q4 (March 2023 quarter) results. EBITDA margins also increased. The stock can hit the target of Rs 25.""

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""Brightcom Group stock price is bullish but also overbought and has resistance now at Rs 25.50 on the daily charts. Investors should book profits at current levels as a daily close below the support of Rs 20.50 could lead to a target of Rs 14.5 in the near term.""

Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks today extended their fall for the second straight session. The domestic indices were dragged by consumer, technology, metal, state-owned lenders, automobile and energy stocks.

""We assure you that we are fully cooperating with Sebi, taking their observations seriously, and working diligently to address all the points mentioned in their show-cause notice, Brightcom said in an exchange filing on June 5.

Brightcom’s clarification was a response to a Moneycontrol report that said the company had not disclosed the financials of its subsidiaries. Following the report, Brightcom uploaded the audited financials of its material subsidiaries on its website.

The market regulator pulled up the company earlier this year for accounting irregularities and disclosure omissions. Brightcom’s asset impairment impact of Rs 868 crore was not reflected in its profit-and-loss account. Sebi said the company overstated its profits in the previous financial years.

The sharp drop promoters' shareholding is also under the Sebi lens. In 2022, when several investors on Twitter flagged this off, Chairman and Co-founder Suresh Kumar Reddy became a partner in four LLPs - Aradhana Commosales, Sarita Commosales, Kalpana Commosales and Shailini Sales.

These LLPs were then moved from the public shareholding section to the promoter category in April 2022, which saw many retail investors tweet their discontent.

""Promoters dumped 19 percent on retail. Then, to hide they suddenly somehow without any commercial transaction, become partner in those LLPs,"" tweeted a user.

Brightcom shares saw a surge in retail interest back in 2021 when the stock skyrocketed from Rs 3 to Rs 117. As financial irregularities were revealed, the company lost close to 90 percent of investors' wealth in a matter of 16 months. Ace investor Shankar Sharma holds 1.25 percent in the company.

The company in a clarification to the bourses said, “We are writing to you today to address the concerns raised in a recent article published by an online financial publisher, on 2 June 2023, regarding our company's financial reporting.

Here’s a look at the six allegations made in the media report along with the company's responses to each of them.

1. The subsidiary financial information of the company appears to be closed and inaccessible, according to the media report. In response, the company said that it has posted the audited financials of its significant subsidiaries on its website, where they are now completely public and accessible.

2. According to the auditor's statement, the financial accounts of 14 of the 16 subsidiaries were not audited, as was noted in the media report. In response, the company stated that because of the complexity of its operations across numerous nations and legal systems, it must adhere to local regulations in each subsidiary, necessitating the involvement of multiple auditors for the audit function.

The company claimed that in the end, the statutory auditor consolidates the subsidiary accounts and examines the company's standalone financial statements.

Additionally, the company said one can be sure that Brightcom Group complies with all legal obligations and follows the world's best corporate governance practises, providing full disclosure of the financial information for all of its Group companies in its consolidated financial reports.

3. The report stated that asset impairment was not recorded as a cost in the P&L, and that overall comprehensive income for FY20 was Rs 177 crore. According to the company, 10 subsidiaries were required to recognise an impairment impact totaling Rs 868.30 crore in accordance with local legislation in their respective nations/jurisdictions. It was not expected to have a direct effect on the parent company's profit and loss statement.

4. The news report also raised concerns about the type of assets that resulted in such a high impairment charge. According to the company's response, it continuously invests in its AdTech platforms to keep up with the rapidly evolving tech world. This includes updating current products and creating new ones. Depending on where the product development is in the process, the cost associated with these activities is correctly recorded.

“It falls under categories such as other current assets, intangible assets under development, and other intangible assets, depending on the stage of development and launch. Asset impairment charges are complex accounting treatments, and we assure you that all instances have been handled diligently with appropriate professional judgement,"" said the company in its exchange filing.

5. The media report mentioned the alleged ambiguity around the components of the balance sheet's 'other advances' head. The company clarified that it was actively improving its reporting to give a more thorough explanation of the 'others' category and to ensure that the accounting principles are more precisely and clearly stated.

6. The media report also mentioned the tax obligations of the company while having a lot of cash and payment defaults to Axis banks. The company said that the third-party collateral owners' withdrawal of support caused the loan recall problem, which compelled the company to stop the loans. By March 2021, they had paid off these loans. It further stated that it is pleased to report that the company has been debt-free ever since.

Sanjiv Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Finserv Ltd, the holding company of the group, said mobile phone users would soon have the right to be forgotten by Bajaj Finance.

""You will see in three months' time, on our website and our app, an option -- you click it and we will never bother you again. You'll have the right to be forgotten with us but then make sure, you never come back to us for our products and solutions,"" Bajaj said on telemarketing calls used to push loans.

Bajaj's comment comes at a time when Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has asked telcos to take immediate actions to curb the menace of unsolicited commercial communications (UCC) that, at times, leads to instances of frauds and scams.

According to Bajaj, loans solicited through “push calls” account for less than 15 per cent of the NBFC's business and the aim is to bring it down to less than 10 per cent and then even lower the organisation gets more digital.

“The aim would ideally be getting that 15 per cent down to 10 per cent or take it down to zero so that our calls would only be service calls. All promotional activities will happen through our digital channels. That is the aim we want to get to,” he said.

54	BAJFINANCE	Bajaj Finance Ltd	Chairman Sanjiv Bajaj’s solution to address unnecessary loan calls from Bajaj Finance	"Bajaj Finance Managing Director Sanjiv Bajaj recently tackled the issue of unwanted telemarketing calls received by individuals from the company. During the launch of Bajaj Finance’s mutual funds business, he made an important announcement stating that Bajaj Finance will soon introduce an opt-out option for customers who do not wish to receive such calls. Bajaj emphasised that once customers choose this option, they should refrain from applying for any of the company’s products. In approximately three months, Bajaj Finance’s website and web app will provide users with an option to click and ensure that they never receive bothersome calls again. Bajaj assured customers that they have the right to be forgotten by the company if they opt out of telemarketing calls.

It is advised that by choosing to opt out, customers should also commit to not approaching Bajaj Finance for their financial needs in the future. Despite issuing three million loans per month, the company receives 1,500 complaints per quarter related to telemarketing calls.

During the launch of Bajaj Finance’s mutual funds business, Sanjiv Bajaj also acknowledged the importance of resolving the concerns faced by the 1,500 complainants without jeopardising the financial inclusion opportunities for the remaining three million customers.

“We know we have to get to zero complaints. But I think we also need to understand that some of this, unfortunately, does happen in the world that we live in… You will see in three months’ time on our website and our app an option—you click it and we will never bother you again. You will have the right to be forgotten by us,” he said as reported by Business Today.

Currently, approximately 15 percent of Bajaj Finance’s business comes from outreach via telemarketing calls. However, the company aims to reduce this figure to 10 percent and eventually eliminate telemarketing as a promotional strategy altogether.

Recognising the growing problem of unwanted mobile calls and text messages from telemarketers, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) intervened. TRAI asked all telecom service providers to verify registered headers and message templates on the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) platform. Additionally, the regulatory body mandated the blocking of all unverified headers and message templates within 30 and 60 days, respectively.

In response to these regulations, telecom service providers have implemented an artificial intelligence and machine language-based system since 1 May. This system effectively monitors and prevents spam calls, representing a significant technological measure against unsolicited commercial communications.

By implementing the opt-out option and adhering to regulatory requirements, the company strives to provide a better customer experience in the future.

He feels Thursday's swing high could be considered as a new higher top of the sequence and further weakness for the short term is expected to be a higher bottom of the sequence.

Nifty had a small gap up opening which was then followed by a range bound move for a couple of hours. This was predominantly due to banknifty which was trading almost flat in the opening hours.

""It is expected that the RBI will maintain its pause on rate hikes, considering the significant improvement in inflation, which has now come within the RBI's comfort zone. Furthermore, the participation of FIIs as net buyers, after a brief halt, contributed to today's market rally, particularly driven by mid- and small-cap stocks,"" he said.

68	CANFINHOME	Can Fin Homes Ltd	Can Fin Homes Shares Gain After Jefferies Raises Target Price	"Shares of Can Fin Homes Ltd. rose on Wednesday after Jefferies raised its target price and earnings per share estimates for the stock.

The brokerage raised the target price on the mortgage lender to Rs 850 per share from Rs 705 earlier. The new price implies a 19% upside from the closing price on Tuesday.

The brokerage has also raised the company’s FY24–25 EPS estimates by 1–2% as a consequence of revised estimates on net interest margins, operating expenditures, and tax rates.

Jefferies maintained a ""buy"" rating on the stock, anticipating that the company will benefit from an expansion in net interest margins. A fall in deposit rates is expected to result in better margins with the decline in system-wide interest rates and a lag in the re-pricing of home loan rates.

Over the next three years, NIMs may gradually increase as interest rates stabilise, Jefferies said."	"Shares of Can Fin Homes Ltd. rose on Wednesday after Jefferies raised its target price and earnings per share estimates for the stock.

69	BHEL	Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd	ABB India shares at Rs 5,000? UBS upgrades stock to ‘Buy’. Here’s why	"Foreign brokerage UBS has upgraded ABB India shares to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' earlier, with a revised target of Rs 5,000 against Rs 3,770, suggesting a 21 per cent upside over June 9's closing value of Rs 4,148.90. Short-cycle demand for ABB's industrial products has been stronger than expected on the back of its deeper geographical penetration, UBS said.

Electrification and motion are set to lift margins even though ABB remains dependent on imports in process automation and robotics, it said adding that ABB India's Indian leadership is highly focused on expanding market opportunities, especially in low voltage electrification.

""While consensus margin forecasts have risen 120 bps in the past 12 months, we think ABB's true potential from value-accretive electrification and motion has yet to be priced in. A growing contribution from highly scalable new segments and products aid growth and OPM, supported by active capex,"" it said.

UBS said it remains bullish on industrial automation and low voltage electrification demand and sees an improving case for further operating profit margin growth.

""We lift margins by 130 bps and earnings by 10-17 per cent for CY23-25E, which we believe realistically reflects the sustainability of margins, driven by volume and revenue mix benefits from electrification and motion. Our CY24/25E earnings forecasts are 10 per cent/15 per cent ahead of consensus. We raise our price target from Rs 3,770 to Rs5,000, and upgrade the stock to Buy, based on a peak PE of 70 times (vs the 62 times earlier), pricing in the potential for greater growth-led capex,"" it said.

UBS' order of preferences in the industrial sector coverage is now Siemens, ABB India, Larsen & Toubro and BHEL.

With wide innovation-driven moats and high value-added products, ABB is extending its geographical reach in its leadership segments, such as motors, drives, low and medium voltage switches, and switchgears, which in UBS said have a lot more room to grow profitably.

Further momentum in service-layered long-term projects points to medium-to long-term growth in revenue share from high margin services, it said.

69	BHEL	Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd	We are expecting significant number of orders from thermal sector over 3-4 years: Nalin Shinghal, BHEL	"""But now things are looking up significantly because as we are all aware, the thermal sector is picking up, though we all understand it is for a medium period. It is not for a long period,"" says Nalin Shinghal , CMD, BHEL Yes, that is true. So, if you are looking at an overview of how the business has been moving, we all know that almost three years, our primary business, we had been focusing on the thermal sector and almost for a complete three year period from August 19 till September 22 there was no orders in the thermal sector so that had affected us immensely.The material costs had been going up, steel prices, copper prices, and there have been project delays, COVID related and otherwise so that whole thing was hitting us pretty badly.But now things are looking up significantly because as we are all aware, the thermal sector is picking up, though we all understand it is for a medium period. It is not for a long period.But in the shorter period, we are expecting over the next two to three, four years, significant amount of orders in the thermal side. And we have made huge efforts at diversification which have started bearing fruit. So we saw the Vande Bharat order happening recently, which 80 Vande Bharat train with 35 years of maintenance that is one of our biggest orders and then of course, thermal orders are coming in.Coal gasification is another area that we are looking at. Defence, we have got an order for 22 upgraded SRGMs so the total defence order is almost Rs 3600 crores in the last year.So diversification is paying off and non-thermal has been 40% of our order book in the last year so that is a big change and going forward, I think this should really help us.Let me put it this way that typically our orders are long cycle orders. It is only after the second year, third year, fourth year onwards that the major cash flows start coming in. Similarly, Vande Bharat is a 78 month order which only after two years, we say we deliver the first prototype, thereafter the second prototype and then the flow start.The defence order is about 24-25 is when our deliveries start. So 24-25 onwards, we are and you see the order we have been the nuclear order that we have got.There also in the current year, we are ramping up and next year, major portions will start happening. So by 24-25, we should start the turnover and the things should start looking much better. Cash flow should also improve because our contract assets, a lot of the thermal projects which are in the closure phases, they will also get completed, the older projects. So that part of it also will improve for 24-25 onwards.We have already got a very major order from the railways in April itself. Now further orders we are looking at happening in thermal. The number of orders are coming in in the thermal sector so I think they will balance out. They should balance out and over a period we are looking at non-thermal becoming the largest share of our turnovers.It will certainly not be a swift transition. It is a very major transition happening. So the ordering has started happening, the delivery will follow. And yes, it will certainly take two to three years for that to be fully in place.You see, while we have a huge land banks, the issue really is that this is all on a right to use basis. So we do not really own it in that sense. There are some bits which we do own where we have put some proposals in place for monetisation. But the big numbers that we all talk about or hear about, those are all right to use where we will not be able to do it.No, all our tenders are competitive bidding. There is nothing we get on getting preference. So these are all coming through competitive bidding. Vande Bharat was very, very tough fight and we have done that.That is right.No, the money you see, there is a huge effort on cost optimization, on the engineering.Engineering the entire thing, looking at our complete procurement cycle and then timely deliveries. And you see, this has a very major maintenance component where we expect substantial gains to come. So both sides we are working, there is a lot of effort going in for ensuring profitability in the delivery itself and thereafter in the services side.The entire Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India, that is a very major plus for us. We have been working for indigenization of our own imports. We have done a huge effort in that. And then we have worked for other PSUs, how to indigenize their import components.And then in addition to that, we are also looking at doing non-OEM spares for the power sector. So I think this whole thing is going to really help us substantially.We should expect diversified and fast moving engineering major, which is supplying to the world and supplying spread across the sectors. I think that is what we should expect.Unfortunately, I would not give numbers because that is one thing we do not give into any numbers on the projections or any advice on that.As I said, without getting into numbers, let us look at the areas we already talked about. We talked about railway, we talked about defence. Then in addition to that, coal gasification, while thermal power is on the downturn but then we already have a target for 2030 for 100 million tons of coal gasification.BHEL has the only proven technology for gasification of the Indian coal. And we have now commercialized, gone to the commercial scale with that. We are in the process; we have already signed an MOU with Coal India in the process of setting up a JV for that.So that is going to be another very major sort of a business coming up. So these put together, when I say world class, the elements are in terms of the engineering capability, which you would you would agree that there are very few organizations in the country which can match BHEL's engineering capability as well as manufacturing capability.So quality is another very major initiative that we have taken on that. And over the last three years, we have been quality first, we have worked on a quality first initiative, which has already started paying us dividends."	"""But now things are looking up significantly because as we are all aware, the thermal sector is picking up, though we all understand it is for a medium period.

69	BHEL	Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd	Nomura downgrades BHEL when thermal power ordering looks encouraging	"Nomura downgrades BHEL when thermal power ordering looks encouraging

live bse live

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

At a time when the Street is confident about thermal-power ordering for Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), Nomura has downgraded its rating on the shares of the largest government-owned power generation equipment manufacturer.

Nomura has cut its rating on BHEL shares to ‘reduce’ from ‘neutral’ and trimmed its target price to Rs 61 from Rs 79 to bake in the slower pace of cash generation. The global brokerage firm has also cut its EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) estimate by 13 percent and 4 percent for FY24 and FY25, respectively, to factor in the delayed order inflow and still weak gross margins.

Over the past one year, BHEL shares have zoomed 62 percent in comparison to the benchmark Nifty 50’s 12 percent gain.

Nomura attributes this outperformance of BHEL to expectations of a strong recovery in thermal power tendering and the progress in recovery of receivables, and, hence, revival in cash flows.

“While we believe that thermal-power tendering prospects remain strong, we are unsure of EBITDA margin and cash-generation prospects,” it said.

Operating cash flow has turned negative in FY23, with a substantial rise in contract assets due to weak gross margins at 30 percent, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 40 percent, owing to a rise in contract assets. This has led to a rise in total debtors by Rs 3,100 crore YoY to Rs 36,300 crore, Nomura explained.

BHEL reported an operating cash flow outflow of Rs 740 crore, compared to a positive operating cash flow of Rs 660 crore in FY22.

Besides a negative operating cash flow, Nomura said that BHEL’s recent order wins look aggressive, with it having to cut bid price to match an offer by another bidder, which is likely to limit the scope of gross margin recovery.

According to the global financial services company, BHEL’s stock is currently trading at the higher end (16 times) of its long-term EV/EBITDA, which appears expensive, unless there is a marked improvement in profitability.

What other brokerages believe

Nuvama Institutional Equities sees a limited upside potential in BHEL, despite factoring in 4–5 GW of fresh order inflow and margins expanding to 6 percent by FY25. The brokerage firm has retained its ‘hold’ rating on the stock with a hike in target price to Rs 85 from Rs 80.

While the government focus has shifted towards renewables, most analysts believe thermal ordering will revive, keeping in mind the government’s target of having 500 GW of installed renewable energy by 2030.

BHEL is one of the largest heavy engineering and manufacturing companies in India in the energy-related/infrastructure sector. It caters to the core sectors of the Indian economy, like power generation and transmission, industry, transportation, telecommunications and renewable energy.

About the thermal pipeline, the company said in its conference call that it is favourably placed and is looking at 3.7 GW orders. Additionally, projects worth 6 GW are currently under the bidding process for FY24 and projects worth 9 GW are expected to be announced in FY25-26.

According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, there has been a recovery in the thermal sector after a gap of 4-5 years. This recovery is primarily driven by an increase in power demand, which is positively impacting the company's business prospects. Additionally, the company is also benefiting from the scale- up in sectors such as railways, defence, green hydrogen, and others.

However, the brokerage firm believes the revenue mix of BHEL may continue to be dominated by the power sector in the near future.

BHEL’s management affirmed a structural turnaround in the power equipment market. It also gave a strong outlook for the industry segment, and stated its objective of making it over 50 percent of the business in the medium term.

Prabhudas Lilladher has upgraded its rating on the stock to ‘reduce’ from ‘sell’, with a hike in target price to Rs 67 from Rs 36 to build in a gradual revival of thermal tendering and execution pace.

Meanwhile, ICICI Securities highlighted that strong thermal ordering outlook for FY24 and thereafter bodes well for order inflows and profitability in a low-competition environment.

With an increase in industrial activity, demand for power is on an increasing trend. This will, in turn, increase the demand for new coal-based power plants.

BHEL could be a strong beneficiary of this demand leading to an annual ordering of more than Rs 35,000 crore from FY24-26, highlighted Antique Stock Broking.

It believes BHEL will witness a meaningful reversal in its ordering cycle over the next 3-4 years, led by both industry (non-power) and power segments.

“Supported by strong ordering, improving execution, and benefit of operating leverage, BHEL's earnings are anticipated to climb up five -fold over FY24-26,” according to Antique Stock Broking.

Hence, the brokerage firm has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 110, which is 20 times its FY25 EPS. ICICI Securities has also maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock, with a target price of Rs 100.

71	BHARTIARTL	Bharti Airtel Ltd	Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports among 21 lossmaking companies to pay dividend	"Prior approval of shareholders is mandatory if dividend is declared out of general reserves.

Despite making losses in FY23, some companies have recommended paying dividends, a matter that is subject to approval from shareholders. The promoter holding in these companies ranges from 33 percent to 75 percent, which means they will be the major beneficiaries of the dividend payments.

At least 21 companies that posted a net loss on a standalone basis in FY23 have declared dividend payments, a Moneycontrol analysis showed. Some of these companies have made a profit on a consolidated level because their subsidiaries posted positive earnings.

According to Makarand Joshi, founding partner of MMJC & Associates, a corporate compliance firm, dividends must be paid based on a company’s standalone profits

Among the lossmaking companies are Bharti Airtel, which announced a dividend of 100 percent on the face value of each Rs 5 share, and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, which declared a dividend of 250 percent on the face value of its Rs 2 share.

Sunteck Realty and Bombay Burmah Trading Corp plan to pay dividends of 150 percent and 60 percent, respectively. Other companies announced dividend payments ranging from 5 percent to 250 percent.

Airtel, Adani promoters

In absolute terms, Bharti Airtel and Adani Ports & SEZ announced a total dividend pay-out of about Rs 2,984 crore and Rs 1,080 crore, respectively.

In Bharti Airtel, the promoters hold a 55-percent stake and they will get Rs 1,642 crore. The Adani Ports & SEZ promoters, with a 61.03-percent stake, stand to receive Rs 659.16 crore as dividend.

Emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Adani Ports & SEZ remained unanswered.

Sunteck Realty and Bombay Burmah Trading announced a total dividend of Rs 22 crore and Rs 8.4 crore, and their promoters will get Rs 14.77 crore and Rs 5.52 crore, respectively.

RHI Magnesita India and Entertainment Network India have announced a total dividend of Rs 47 crore and 4.77 crore, and their promoters will get Rs 28.25 crore and Rs 3.4 crore, respectively.

Joshi said paying a dividend is a way of returning profit to the shareholders. The Companies Act allows payment of dividend from free reserves even if the company has made a loss. Such payments are subject to restrictions on the amount that can be distributed as dividend.

Companies can also pay dividends from the profit of previous years and from general reserves. If companies pay a dividend from a previous year’s profit, there is no limit on the amount.

If a dividend is paid out of general reserves, there are restrictions on the amount as well as the rate of dividend. In both cases, depreciation must be provided for and losses, if any in the current or previous years, must be adjusted before distributing dividend.

Prior approval

Prior approval of shareholders is mandatory if dividend is declared out of general reserves, but dividend out of a previous year’s profit can be declared by the board on its own as interim dividend, Joshi added.

The decision to pay dividends must be taken after considering factors including the company's expansion plans. The regulator has mandated the top 1,000 listed companies to frame a dividend distribution policy to bring certainty in dividend payments. Proxy advisors have raised concerns when there is inconsistency in dividend distribution.

""It is being seen that a dividend is declared by certain companies to provide income for cash-strapped promoters or group companies. Also, this shows inconsistency in quantum and timing of dividend. It needs to be highlighted here that excessive dividend distribution might eventually lead to erosion of net worth,"" Joshi said."

Pro-Khalistan slogans were raised on the Golden Temple premises on June 6 by supporters and activists of radical Sikh outfits on the 39th anniversary of Operation Blue Star.

Slogans of “Khalistan Zindabad” were also raised by activists of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) led by MP Simranjit Singh Mann and his associate former MP Dhian Singh Mand at the Akal Takht. Mr. Mann was also present on the spot.

Radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa’s activists were seen holding placards bearing portraits of slain militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhidnrawale and raising pro-Khalistan slogans.

Hundreds of Sikh youths, led by the Dal Khalsa, were carrying Khalistani flags and photographs of damaged Akal Takht.

The entire marbled periphery of the Golden Temple near Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of Sikhs, echoed with pro-Khalistan slogans.

Elaborate security arrangements were put in place in Amritsar to ensure that the event passed off peacefully.

The Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh, said in his message to the Sikh community that the need of the hour was that Sikh preachers and scholars should visit villages to promote Sikhism to apprise the youth with rich Sikh tenets and Sikh history in order to unite them under the banner of the Akal Takht.

He spoke about the issue of drug-addiction which has afflicted many youths.

He alleged that governments would never help the Sikh community to make them strong.

He said Sikhs were never scared or panicked even after the incidents that happened in 1984. “Rather, all such incidents had made the Sikh community stronger and Sikhs would continue their struggle to get justice and would never be scared to stand with the truth,” he said.

The Jathedar alleged that conspiracies were being hatched to weaken the Sikh community socially, economically and politically.

Now the time has come for the community to get united, he said.

He said the Sikh community did not have any hopes or expectations from successive governments as they were attempting to take over Sikh religious institutions and also playing a major role in dividing the community through unfair means.

On this occasion, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex Sikh religious body, displayed the bullet-ridden holy “saroop” (physical copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib. The saroop, which was installed in the sanctum sanctorum at that time, was hit by a bullet during the army action in 1984.

The Operation Blue Star was a military operation carried out in 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple."

Further, over 7,500 stores are registered users of Barcelona Club’s business-to-business (B2B) app and the business opens three to four new franchise locations every month.

“Initially, the business was of trading of textiles. Analysing the gap for premium quality garments for the vast middle-class economy of the country, Barcelona was launched with an aim to offer premium but affordable products to the middle class,” says Gupta.

The company operates on four business models—exclusive brand outlet, franchise models, wholesale garment supply with B2B mobile app and online marketplace, and dedicated e-commerce website for direct customers. Incidentally, a majority of Barcelona’s outlets are located in tier-2 and -3 towns.

It is also planning to launch family stores under its brand name that would include products for men, women and children. Incidentally, denim sales account for approximately 52 per cent of its total income.

Interestingly, the company also has a joint venture with former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag’s Viru for sportswear stuff like t-shirt, shorts, track pants, and track suits among other things.

More importantly, the Ahmedabad-based entity is now gearing up to go public on the BSE SME platform with an issue of Rs 48 crore even as it eyes over 350 stores by the end of this year.

“We want to give retail investors an opportunity to be part of India’s fastest growing retail brand. The IPO process itself gives company a mileage in marketing and branding, which is a win-win to raising funds as well adding consumers. It gets company into hyper active mode in all verticals,” says Gupta.

Entering the public markets will entail a detailed scrutiny by analysts with finances and fundamentals being the key focus areas.

The company clocked revenues of Rs 174 crore in FY23 with a net profit of nearly Rs 2.9 crore—a huge jump compared to previous year’s net of Rs 66.38 lakh.

In terms of other important ratios, the return on capital employed (RoCE) was pegged at 14.72 per cent while the return on equity ratio was 27.51 per cent as on March 31, 2023, with the debt-equity ratio at 0.87.

Further, the monthly revenue is currently pegged around Rs 3 crore with a 30 per cent monthly average sales growth and 40 per cent monthly average gross margin. Retail sales, meanwhile, has increased 2.5 times in 2023 when compared to the previous year.

“As the company is raising funds, and promoters are aggressively expanding business, financials to be healthier in future. We are growing at 50 per cent CAGR since last three years, and making it to 100 per cent CAGR year-on-year would be way forward. As our store targets are achieved, revenue targets will eventually be achieved as well. We are creating the network for the company to reach a sustainable annual revenue rate,” says Gupta.

The company has signed Sonu Sood as their new brand ambassador to spearhead all the new range of fashion fits.

“One brand serving more than one crore customers through more than one lakh shops. The company will be adding about one lakh multi-model brand outlets and 500 exclusive brand outlets to its network, which will eventually lead to ultimate goal of revenue targets and brand building. The vision is to create largest network of apparel shops on our B2B app,” says Gupta."

73	BSE	BSE Ltd	Infosys shares have up to 28% upside potential; most attractive risk-reward in IT space, say analysts	"The June quarter results of IT major Infosys are likely to be weak, but that is largely known to the Street. Analysts tracking the stock said headwinds for Infosys are largely priced in and that the stock has most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys is trading at a valuation of 19.6 times one-year forward earnings per share, closer to its last 15-year average multiple of 19 times. ICICI Securities said soft revenue growth in FY24 is already factored in the current stock price, and announcement of mega deal wins will potentially help the stock re-rate from these levels.

""Infosys has already announced 4-5 deal wins in the current quarter (Q1FY24) and has good mega deal pipeline with some deals in advanced stages. We believe risk-reward ratio is favourable with limited downside (8-9 per cent) for Infosys from current levels in a bear case scenario of 8-9 per cent YoY CC revenue growth in FY25E and FY26E,"" it said in its analysis of Infosys annual report.

Shares of Infosys rose 1.64 per cent to a high of Rs 1,286.70 on BSE. ICICI Securities continued to value Infosys at 23 times on FY26 EPS of Rs 80 to arrive at an unchanged target price of Rs 1,641, implying 28 per cent potential upside. The domestic brokerage said Infosys has the most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys' discretionary business has been adversely impacted by the macroeconomic slowdown over the last few months and that the delayed decision-making and higher deal scrutiny will have a direct impact on the deal conversion, said Motilal Oswal Securities. This brokerage sees FY24 revenue growth for Infosys at 5.2 per cent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms, which falls under the lower end of the guidance range.

""Despite near-term weakness, we expect Infosys to be a key beneficiary of acceleration in IT spends in the medium/long term. The stock is currently trading at 18 times FY25E EPS. We value the stock at 21 times FY25E EPS, implying a target price of Rs 1,520,"" it said.

The average price target on Infosys stock at Rs 1,500 suggests a 17 per cent potential upside.

Meanwhile, JM Financial said the probability of Infosys reporting another quarter of sequential decline is not insignificant. Infosys’ March quarter miss was attributable largely to project cancellations in March alone.

""Two months of incremental impact means Infosys’ starting point for 1QFY24 is a revenue deficit of $180mn. Even adjusting for seasonal strengths – higher working days, new project starts, Infosys may not be able to recoup this deficit entirely. We are therefore building a 1 per cent QoQ decline. Most revenue guidance available currently for 1QFY24 - Wipro, Cognizant, EPAM, DAVA - are pointing to a sequential decline anyways,"" said JM Financial.

""A weak start also means CQGR needed in 2H to achieve 4-7 per cent cc revenue growth guidance will rise to 5-9 per cent. Infosys will need a few mega deals to achieve even the lower end of its guidance range, in our view. We assume a healthy pick-up in an otherwise seasonally weak 2H (4 per cent CQGR) as we build impact of mega deals (not won yet),"" it said. This brokerage has a lower target of Rs 1,360 on the stock.

73	BSE	BSE Ltd	Go Fashion shares plunge 5% amid heavy turnover; Sequoia Capital likely seller	"Shares of Go Fashion fell 5 per cent in Monday's trade amid heavy volumes. Against a two-week volume of 2,492 shares, the stock saw 5.28 lakh shares changing hands on BSE on likely stake sale by Sequoia Capital. As per earlier repots, the venture capital firm was looking to offload its entire 10.18 per cent stake in the parent of Indian clothing brand Go Colors through a block deal today.

Following the development, the stock declined 5.07 per cent to hit a low of Rs 1,133.30 on BSE. On NSE, a total of 83,43,762 shares changed hands, with a total turnover of 948.56 crore. A CNBC report earlier suggested the total size of the block deal at Rs 625 crore. As per the report the floor price was set at Rs 1,135 per share, a 5 per cent discount to Friday's closing price of Rs 1,194. JM Financial was reportedly the sole broker for the deal.

Sequoia Capital, till last year, held a 13.8 per cent stake in Go Fashion. It had, however, launched a block deal in December 2022 to sell a 3.7 per cent stake for Rs 228 crore. The Go Fashion move came days after Sequoia Capital decided to split its businesses in China, India and Southeast Asia operations into two independent firms, which will be run without any involvement of Sequoia going forward.

Sequoia Capital held nearly 55 lakh Go Fashion shares accounting for 10.18 per cent stake in Go Fashion as of March 31, 2023. Shares of Go Fashion have jumped 8.4 per cent in the last one month. They are up 21.2 per cent in the last one year.

Go Fashion reported a 20 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 15 crore for the March quarter compared with Rs 12 crore in the year-ago quarter. The company’s total income for the quarter rose 34 per cent to Rs 160 crore compared with Rs 119 crore in the corresponding period of last year.

Sequoia’s China firm would be named Hongshan in English. India and Southeast Asia will be renamed as Peak XV, which will manage more than 400 portfolio companies and assets of $9.2 billion.

Sequoia raised $2.8 billion last year to invest in Indian and Southeast Asian startups, but the majority $2.5 billion remaining will be invested by Peak XV, which is now India's biggest venture capital firm being run by Sequoia's former managing directors in the region.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

75	BPCL	Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd	BPCL’s Bargarh bio-refinery to invigorate circular economy: Pradhan	"State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd's (BPCL) Bargarh 2G bio-refinery which will use rice straw to produce ethanol for mixing in petrol, will invigorate a circular economy and give impetus to waste-to-wealth creation, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Sunday.

Pradhan, who is the Union Minister for HRD, visited the under-construction Bargarh 2G bio-refinery site in Odisha as part of the Vikas Teerth Yatra to mark nine years of the Modi government.

""Bargarh bio-refinery is making steady progress and is expected to be commissioned soon,"" he tweeted.

After producing ethanol from sugarcane, India is now pushing for producing low-carbon fuel from grains and agri waste. This is part of an ambitious programme to mix ethanol in petrol to cut down emissions as well as the country's dependence on imports for meeting oil needs.

Presently, 10 per cent ethanol is mixed in petrol (10 per cent ethanol, 90 per cent petrol) and this volume is targeted to be doubled by 2025. The Bargarh 2G bio-refinery is part of the plan to augment the production of ethanol to meet the higher mixing target.

The Bargarh bio-refinery in Odisha is being built at a cost of Rs 1,607 crore and will produce 100 kilolitres per day of 1G ethanol (ethanol from rice grain) and a similar volume of 2G ethanol (ethanol from rice straw).

""The Bargarh 2G Bio-refinery will invigorate a circular economy, give impetus to waste-to-wealth creation, boost farmers' income & welfare, create large-scale employment, augment indigenous production of green fuel and lead Odisha towards prosperity and self-reliance as envisioned by PM @narendramodi ji,"" Pradhan tweeted.

The plant is the first of its kind in the world with rice-based 1G and 2G bio-ethanol production. Ethanol produced from the plant shall be utilized for blending with petrol under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme for a significant reduction in GHG emissions and savings in crude import bill for India.

""Keeping in mind GoI's focus on #greengrowth and upcoming bio-refineries in Odisha and neighbouring Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, suggested to design relevant courses & modules in ethanol engineering, economics & technology in regional Govt ITI for connecting local youth with the emerging green jobs and also prepare competent and skilled manpower,"" Pradhan tweeted."

75	BPCL	Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd	BPCL commences pilot project for 7% ethanol blended diesel	"State-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and truck manufacturer Ashok Leyland have initiated a pilot programme to test the effectiveness of ED7 (Diesel blended with 7 per cent ethanol) fuel.

The programme aims to transform India’s bio-fuel economy and achieve a stable energy mix. The ED7 fuel, developed by BPCL-R&D, consists of 93 per cent diesel and 7 per cent ethanol. The blend has undergone rigorous testing and validation on the engine test bench in collaboration with Ashok Leyland, the oil marketing company (OMC) said.

BPCL CMD G Krishnakumar said the company is developing sustainable fuel options under the clean fuel development programme in association with leading automotive OEM’s, Ashok Leyland and Hero MotoCorp, and is committed towards developing sustainable fuel options.

“BPCL has commenced supply of E20 in many cities across the nation. Today’s flag off of the Pilot ED7for buses with Ashok Leyland and flex fuels (E27 & E85) for two wheelers along with Hero MotoCorp is a step by BPCL towards our country’s aim of reducing import bill & providing sustainability,” he added.

Pilot project

Ashok Leyland conducted extensive laboratory trials on their engines using the ED7 fuel. The fuel blend showcases a remarkable reduction in pollution levels, including Particulate Matter and Nitrogen oxides (NOx).

It can be seamlessly adopted by diesel vehicles without requiring any significant modifications in engine. After the pilot program, a comprehensive report will be submitted to ARAI, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, for developing a roadmap for commercial implementation of the fuel, BPCL said.

Hero MotoCorp, in alignment with its vision of being the future of mobility, has developed a Flex-Fuel Prototype at its Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur. The vehicle, equipped with a 125cc BS6 engine, can run on ethanol-blended petrol mixtures ranging from 20 per cent (E20) to 85 per cent (E85) ethanol blends.

The Flex-Fuel prototype utilises advanced software to detect the ethanol blend in the fuel and adjust engine control parameters accordingly, ensuring a trouble-free riding experience. The engine’s performance and emissions remain uncompromised across the entire blend range.

77	CENTURYPLY	Century Plyboards (India) Ltd	Up to 50% upside potential! Analysts bullish on these 3 underperforming stocks	"India’s top wood panel firms including Greenply Industries, Greenpanel Industries, and Century Plyboards (India) reported a mixed set of financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Shares of these companies have underperformed the benchmark equity index during the past one year.

With a rally of 4.45 per cent, Century Plyboards (India) emerged as the top gainer in the list. The scrip rose to Rs 579.95 on Friday from Rs 555.20 a year earlier. Greenpanel Industries and Greenply Industries plunged 30.62 per cent and 9.99 per cent, respectively, during the same period. On the other hand, the BSE Sensex advanced 13 per cent during that period.

However, ICICI Securities is optimistic about the wood panel segment driven by a continued uptick in real estate, growing consumer preference for organised players and reasonable valuations. “We have a ‘Buy’ rating on all the stocks under our coverage. We continue to prefer Greenpanel Industries and Century Plyboards in the wood panel industry led by their leadership position in their core categories,” the brokerage said in a report.

Of late, Century Plyboards (India) (CPBI) posted 29.48 per cent YoY growth in net profit at Rs 114.66 crore in Q4FY23. The company’s gross sales increased 7.15 per cent YoY to Rs 965.45 crore during the quarter under review. The bottom line of Greenpanel Industries and Greenply Industries declined 14.48 per cent YoY and 61.80 per cent YoY during the January-March quarter.

Brokerage YES Securities has a ‘Buy’ rating on Greenply Industries (GPIL) with a target price of Rs 250, indicating an upside of over 50 per cent from the current market price.

“GPIL is embarking on a strong growth trajectory wherein we reckon plywood biz to grow by 6 per cent over FY23-FY25 with margins coming in at 10.5 per cent in FY24 and FY25 respectively. MDF will boost performance from FY24 and we expect revenue from this segment to come in at Rs 270 crore and Rs 390 crore in FY24 and FY25, respectively. With major capex behind and debt likely to get repaid from FY24 and ROE and ROCE to improve to 20 per cent and 26 per cent respectively by FY25, we believe GPIL is available at lucrative valuations,” YES Securities said.

Systematix Institutional Equities is positive on Greenpanel Industries with a target price of Rs 439. Shares of the company traded at Rs 330 on June 9.

“We like Greenpanel for its market leadership in the fast-growing MDF industry (finding support from the rising acceptance, strong demand revival in housing units and readymade furniture) and robust financials,” Systematix Institutional Equities said in a report.

In Q4FY23, Greenpanel Industries witnessed an MDF revenue decline of 1 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 31.9 per cent) as blended realisation declined 10.2 per cent YoY (due to a higher share of exports which has lower realisation), while blended volume grew 10.2 per cent YoY (driven by 89.1 per cent YoY growth in exports; domestic volume declined 7.4 per cent YoY). CPBI’s MDF revenue also declined 1.1 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 20.6 per cent) as volume declined 2.8 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 7.2%) and realisation increased 1.5 per cent YoY.

As per government data, MDF import volume increased around 234 per cent and 41 per cent YoY and QoQ in Q4FY23, respectively, while realisation fell 37 per cent and 12 per cent YoY and QoQ, respectively. Thailand (35 per cent), Vietnam (30 per cent) and Malaysia (19 per cent) were the top contributors to import volume in Q4FY24.

Per industry participants, furniture demand in the US and Europe was subdued in the past few quarters, resulting in MDF exports from Southeast Asian countries being diverted to other regions (including India). The average monthly run-rate of imports in Q4FY23 (21,944 MT per month) was near the pre-Covid levels of FY19 (22,525 MT per month), which is expected to pose near-term demand and pricing headwinds for domestic players (as landed cost of imports is 20 per cent lower than domestic brands).

“MDF prices in international markets have seen an increase of 7–8 per cent so far in Q1FY24, which, if sustained, may result in lower imports in domestic markets going ahead. For FY24, CPBI has guided for 30 per cent YoY volume growth (enabled by capacity expansion) and 20 per cent EBITDA margin, while Greenpanel has guided for 12-15 per cent YoY volume growth (with a continued focus on driving export volume growth) and 23-25 per cent margins,” ICICI Securities said.

Nuvama maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on CPBI last month with a target price of Rs 675. Shares of the company traded at Rs 579 on June 9. “CPBI’s expansion plans across all segments are on track. Despite near-term demand and margin headwinds (due to higher inflation and rising timber prices), we expect the margin to stabilise in FY24, as timely price hikes and falling chemical prices should aid the margin. We are optimistic about its long-term growth prospects due to its diverse product portfolio, extensive distribution, and strong brand,” Nuvama said in a report.

84	CESC	CESC Ltd	Power tariff hike shocks industry, trade and commerce bodies in Mysuru	"June 08, 2023 07:16 pm | Updated 07:16 pm IST - MYSURU

The MSMEs, commercial and other trade bodies in Mysuru have flayed the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) for the hike in power tariff.

The CESC issued the orders on May 31 and said that the Fuel and Power Purchase Cost computation for the period January 2023 to April 2023 has been finalised and the final order has been issued. It has said that the FPPCA of ₹2.42 per unit of sale to be collected in all the energy bills to be issued to all category of consumers except those coming under Bhagya Jyothi, Kutir Jyothi and IP sets of 10 HP and below.

Taking exception to what it described as a steep hike, the stakeholders from the industrial and trade bodies have hit out at the CESC and cautioned that it could cripple the industrial and commercial sector if the hike was not revoked.

The Mysore chamber of commerce & Industry (MCCI) president K.B. Lingaraju and KIADB Industrial Area Manufacturers Association (KIAMA) vice-president K. Ravindra Prabhu said the hike has come as a shock and disappointment.

They said the fixed charges rate have been increased by ₹70/HP and energy charges by 25 paisa per unit pushing industries in general and MSMEs in particular in Karnataka towards closure.

Mr. Lingaraju and Mr. Ravindra Prabhu said that even home and cottage industries have not been spared and the hike will affect dhobis, bakeries, telephone booths run by handicapped people, small artisans, job typing, Sulabh and Nirmal Shouchalaya, STD/ISTD/Fax facility etc. ‘’The projected losses of CESC to offset which it has resorted to hike, was mainly due to the wrong policies, irregularities and inefficiency of CESC,’’ they added.

The MCCI president Mr. Lingaraju urged the State Government to defer its power hike move till normalcy returns in the economy. He said the hike in power tariff has distressed the industrial and trade sector which are reeling under a range of challenges amidst local and global factors that are beyond their control.

Similar views were expressed by Suresh Kumar Jain of MSME Council and Mysore Industries Association. He said the MSME was struggling to recoup after the pandemic before which it was hit by the global slowdown in the economy. ‘’At a time when the economy was showing traces of growth, the CESC has short-circuited the growth engine through power hike. This could have a negative bearing on drawing fresh investments while the existing players may prefer to shift to other States,’’ he added.

C. Narayana Gowda, representing the hospitality sector, said that the gains made in high tourist traffic has been neutralised by hike in power tariff. For establishments which were receiving electricity bill of ₹4 lakh per month have to shell out anywhere up to ₹6 lakh per month and the cascading impact will be on the general increase in prices of all services and products, he added."

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

89	COROMANDEL	Coromandel International Ltd	Why deadly Balasore train accident should serve as an amber signal for Indian Railways	In the last few years, Raftaar (meaning speed) has been more than just a name of a railway scheme. It has become a catchphrase in Rail Bhawan’s discourse and action. Modernisation of technology, deployment of high-powered locos, use of modern coaches and upgrade of tracks have all been directed at a single goal: acceleration of the Indian Railways . The national transporter which runs about 20,000 trains and ferries nearly 8 billion passengers a year can no longer chug along. Vande Bharat is tested for a speed of 180 kmph and its maximum speed is set at 160 kmph. The Railways is gearing up to increase train speed to 160 kmph in Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah sections, covering about 3,000 km, by late next year, a significant move considering 160 kmph is now permitted only in a small section between New Delhi and Agra.In the devastating triple train accident in Odisha’s Balasore recently, which claimed 288 lives and injured more than 1,000 people, the Coromandel Shalimar Express, running at 128 kmph, and the YesvantpurHowrah Superfast, at 126 kmph, were nearing the speed limit of 130 kmph. Though speed won’t be a subject of inquiry — as none of the trains was overspeeding — this deadly episode should be seen as an amber signal to the transport behemoth that it must continue its journey carefully, and speed up only with safety gears on.On June 2, an accident involving three trains — two passenger trains and one freight train — took place in Balasore in Odisha. At around 7 pm, the Coromandel Shalimar Express, heading to Chennai and running at 128 kmph, moved toward the loop line instead of taking the main line and crashed into a stationary freight train. The freight train, carrying iron ores, was like a hard wall, and the impact of the crash was enormous, forcing the Coromandel express to derail. Some coaches flew off to another track and hit the last two coaches of the Yesvantpur-Howrah Superfast that was coming from the opposite direction.While a CBI investigation is on and the exact reason of the accident is not yet public, railway officers in the know have ruled out any error on the part of the loco driver or trackman. The Coromandel express driver, they say, received the green signal, meaning the train was to go on the main line but the train automatically entered the loop line. A loop line is a branch line that leaves the main line and rejoins it after a short distance, and any train entering it invariably gets the yellow signal, indicating that the driver needs to proceed cautiously.Railway Board member Jaya Verma Sinha said in a presser on June 4 that the driver, when he was still conscious, disclosed that he had received the green signal. He succumbed to his injuries later. It is suspected that the setting of the point machine, a device that enables trains to change track, was changed. That means someone in charge of maintenance committed a grave mistake in the standard protocol. Only an investigation will establish whether it was a mistake due to negligence or lack of training, or whether it was a sabotage. At this juncture, it appears the signal failure was due to human intervention.A relay room is a special room adjacent to the station master’s room filled with S&T (signalling and telecommunication) equipment. It relays information electrically. The room contains relays (a type of device) for various forms of signalling, and is double-locked, which means two officials will have a key each. In this particular accident, as the signal light and the direction of the train do not match, it is suspected that the crash originated in this room. Investigators will have to find out who all were present in the last round of repair or maintenance work, and who tampered with the system and if it was by design.As the Coromandel Express, at full speed, rammed into a goods train weighed down with iron ore, it was bound to be a devastating accident. But many lives would have been saved had its coaches not hit the rear portion of the Yesvantpur Howrah Superfast coming at a speed of 126 kmph from the other side. Had the incident taken place half a minute later, the other train would have passed the area. But if the incident had happened 30-40 seconds earlier, the entire Yesvantpur Howrah train would have been damaged, making the accident far bigger than it is now.Kavach is an indigenously developed train collision avoidance system meant for preventing accidents due to human error such as crossing the red signal and overspeeding. The system is designed to halt locomotives moving towards each other 380 metres apart. The section where the accident took place is not covered under Kavach. Even if the loco of the Coromandel Express had been fitted with Kavach, it would not have helped, say officials. When the setting in the Relay Room was wrong, no device would have worked perfectly. Also the train, once it entered the loop line, had a margin of just 50-60 metres before it hit the goods train, leaving no room for any mechanical manoeuvring.This automatic train protection system is currently deployed only in 1,455 route km in South Central Railway, protecting 77 trains, according to a reply to a Rajya Sabha question in December 2022. Installation of Kavach worth Rs 13,000 crore has been sanctioned for 34,000 km. First priority are Delhi-Howrah and Delhi-Mumbai sections followed by other high density network (HDN) routes (about 11,000 route km in total) such as Mumbai Chennai, Howrah - Chennai, etc. According to the blueprint, the system will then be installed in highly used network (HUN) routes (about 23,000 route km). According to estimates, about 96% railway traffic is carried on HDN and HUN routes even though the Railways’ total route length is 68,103 km.Past railway accident records suggest that mishaps take place mainly due to human error. In 2021-22, for instance, out of 34 consequential train accidents (with 9 deaths in total), 20 took place because of the railway staff ’s failure while four accidents were due to non-railway staff ’s negligence. Equipment failure caused only four accidents. There was one case of sabotage. Let’s take 2016-17, a year of high casualty, when 195 people were killed in 103 accidents. 86 accidents (83.4%) were due to human failure. Two accidents were acts of sabotage. Another two were due to machine failure. Other reasons were incidental factors and a combination of factors.Track maintainers (popularly called gangmen), who walk on the tracks to check their integrity, use an archaic method of bursting crackers to alert loco drivers when they spot a faulty track. When a gangman finds a crack on the track, he runs half a kilometre towards the side from where he anticipates the next train will come. He places a small, round cracker on the track, assuming that it will explode once the train runs over it, alerting the driver who will slow down. Drivers are not allowed to carry phones. Indian Railways has yet to deploy machines that video-graph the track to check its safety.Indigenously developed Vande Bharat trains can run at a speed of 160 kmph. But at present that speed is allowed only in a part of the 200-km-long section between New Delhi and Agra. Gatiman Express has been running at this speed between these two cities, thanks to the deployment of European Train Control System Level-1. With the government giving its nod to develop over 1,000 Vande Bharat trains (21 have been manufactured and 18 deployed), India will soon have a huge capacity to run trains at this speed. An upgrade of Delhi-Howrah and DelhiMumbai routes, about 3,000 km in total, to run trains at 160 kmph, is likely to be over by the end of next year. The high-speed train corridor project (200 kmph-plus) under construction between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is not factored in here as it has access control and will follow all international safety protocols.For the rest of the railway projects, speed has to go hand in hand with safety. Though the train collision avoidance system, Kavach, will be deployed before the Delhi Howrah and the Delhi-Mumbai sections are opened up for trains running at 160 kmph, investigators probing the Odisha crash must also look at other possible safety lapses that may occur in the future. As the recent accident has shown, Kavach can’t be the only shield for the Railways to ensure safety. It has to deploy a better fail-safe mechanism.

89	COROMANDEL	Coromandel International Ltd	Five days after Odisha accident, Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express resumes journey	"June 07, 2023 09:35 pm | Updated 10:13 pm IST - Kolkata

Five days after it met with a tragic accident near Balasore in Odisha, the 12841 Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express resumed services on Wednesday. The train left the Shalimar station from West Bengal’s Howrah district at 3.25 p.m. from platform number 2.

The general compartments of the train were crowded, filled mostly with migrant workers going to other States for work. “I am not at all scared. It will be good if there is increased surveillance,” Pintu, a migrant worker who is travelling to Visakhapatnam said. Another migrant worker who boarded the train said he is heading to Kerala for work but admitted feeling a little scared. “There is fear but we have little option but to take the train and report to work,” he said.

Ranjit Mandal, along with a few other villagers from Sandeshkhali in the State’s South 24 Parganas, has boarded the train in the hope of finding his 18-year-old son who is still missing after the accident on June 2. “The name of my son is Dipankar. He is 18 years old. We were in Odisha but could not find him. We are going again in the hope of finding him,” the father said.

Long queue

Hours before the train arrived at the platform, there was a long queue in front of the train’s general compartment. By the time the train was ready to depart it became difficult to enter the general compartment. Young men were huddled on the upper berths with their bags beside them. Those who could not manage to get places to sit were standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the compartment. Amidst the usual din of the railway journey, their faces were expressionless. In the crowd were some who were taking the journey to other States for the first time in search of work. Not many were keen to share their names and districts they hailed from.

Dipak Sharma, who is going to Bhubaneswar, said so many lives were lost for no fault of the people but for the mistake of the Railways. “In future the Railways should be more careful when it comes to passenger safety,” he said.

The passengers taking the train also comprised families seeking medical help in southern States, armed forces personnel reporting back to work and job-seekers taking the train for an urgent interview.

A spokesperson of the South Eastern Railway said the tracks had been repaired and the train would follow its usual route. According to the West Bengal government, so far 103 people from the State have lost their lives and 30 to 40 people are still reported missing. Most of the deceased were migrant workers and were travelling in the general compartment when the train met with the accident on June 2."

100	DABUR	Dabur India Ltd	FMCG stocks to do reasonably well for this year: Anand Tandon	"""Well, yes, I think this was a case that one made last year that with the inflation going up, strong brands will be able to pass that on and therefore will do well, despite the fact that the raw material prices were up. The raw material prices now are down and the prices at the retail end have moved up. So consequently, you would expect to see a margin expansion coming through,"" says Anand Tandon , Independent Analyst.Well, this sector obviously is doing very well. There is no question. You can see both the ARR, the occupancy, and the room rents are much higher than they have been in the recent several years now because of COVID and after. So the delta obviously is in favour of these companies. However, you have to remember that these typically are fairly capital-intensive projects. And even a company like Indian Hotels, for example, has now put up a whole new segment where they are looking at franchising out and taking over properties on a management contract basis rather than putting up money. So, that is a model that works reasonably well provided somebody else is willing to put up the capital. So it becomes more a services business than an asset-owning business which means that companies like Indian Hotels and some of the newer companies may actually be a little better positioned than, for example, an EIH or even an ITC Group Hotel business where they tend to own more of their properties.That said, I think this will remain a cyclical business. Near term, of course, the cycle is on the upside. So, for the near term, I do not think that there is any issue in terms of owning these stocks. But you have to be careful about when the cycle turns because it will turn without warning. It is not as if the managements have perfect vision in terms of being able to forecast.Well, yes, I think this was a case that one made last year that with the inflation going up, strong brands will be able to pass that on and therefore will do well, despite the fact that the raw material prices were up. The raw material prices now are down and the prices at the retail end have moved up. So consequently, you would expect to see a margin expansion coming through.Volume growth may be a little more suspect this year in my view except for those again which are rural facing. So you may expect to see companies like Dabur actually do better.But overall, I think the consumer space has been reasonably buoyant and I would expect to see some margin expansion in the current year, which means that the earnings will sustain. Overall, however, this is a very expensive space for the simple reason that you have companies which are still trading in the teens, I mean where the earnings growth are in the teens by and large and they are trading at 50-60 times forward earnings. So you have to be a little careful about the segment you want to choose if you are not going to be surprised. That said, as I mentioned, overall the market direction is up. So therefore, you would expect to see the consumer business, especially FMCG, do reasonably well for this year.So I think if you are looking at healthcare you have to break it up into pharma and hospitals. I think the smaller hospitals or the companies like Aster and the NHS etc. have done exceedingly well over the last few years, as has Apollo. But Apollo is a little more expensive at this stage, perhaps I would expect that continues because the overall trend in that segment of the market is going to be more corporatisation, smaller companies getting acquired, perhaps single standalone hospitals merging into chains and so on.So that kind of consolidation will actually favour the listed players especially the larger ones. The valuations, no doubt, are a bit of an issue but I think you have enough levers to be able to raise earnings at various points of time. So it is not like they are overly priced compared to what earnings growth is possible. When you are looking at pharma that has been a slightly depressed space I think largely because the API business has not done well.I think in the US that is beginning to turn around now. And I would imagine that that should enable many companies who are somewhat under pressure over the last 24 months to actually do reasonably well.So in that sense more than domestic pharma which has been a consistent performer, I would expect the delta to come from companies selling APIs and generics in the US market and the developed market. And I think there are several of those which are listed which should do well.Yes, absolutely. I would imagine so. They are wholesale borrowers and therefore obviously in an interest rate up cycle since they do not have the ability to raise liabilities that becomes a problem. You are borrowing from banks. Once the banks find that they are not able to raise interest rates further obviously NBFCs which are lending to a slightly more riskier set of clients and with perhaps less security etc. are able to charge higher interest rates.So their margins are likely to expand. So for now I would imagine that is the phase we are in. Assuming that there is no change in RBI stance you would have interest rates frozen for a while and that will mean that the asset book that the NBFCs put up will be able to give them a margin which is perhaps disproportionate to what the banks are probably able to raise at this stage."	"The raw material prices now are down and the prices at the retail end have moved up.

Bank Nifty is in a very tight range in between 44000 to 44500.

Britannia, one can look at targets of Rs 5000 from here. Of course, one should be prepared to buy on tranches towards support zones of Rs 4600 as well. Tata Consumer also has given a strong breakout now above 800, one can expect targets of Rs 845 to Rs 860 zones from here.I have two buys; one would be in Power Grid. Power Grid Futures trading at around Rs 240 odd zones, now it has a very strong support zone at around Rs 237-238 zones so that would be the stop loss and look for targets till Rs 251 on immediate basis.The other one would be a buy in Syngene. Syngene is also futures trading at around Rs 738. Strong support zones built up at Rs 720 zones, put writing is very aggressive there so that would be the stop loss and look for targets of Rs 780 to Rs 800 zones."

101	CYIENT	Cyient Ltd	IT stocks: Weak EPAM guidance sends Persistent, Mphasis, Coforge, Cyient shares falling; TCS, Infosys down 2% each	"Concerns over demand slowdown in discretionary spending in IT sector sent many midcap IT shares such as Persistent Systems, Mphasis, Coforge and Cyient tumbling in Tuesday's trade, even as largecap stocks such as TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech restricted losses. This is as US-based EPAM Systems cut its Calendar 2023 revenue growth outlook again, expecting a 2 per cent decline in revenues in the constant currency terms at the mid-point of the guided band.

Analysts noted that EPAM has been hit by high exposure to discretionary spending and certain company-specific factors and that domestic Indian IT firms have a more balanced portfolio between discretionary and maintenance spending.

Yet, ""we believe the recent run-up in the sector has been ahead of fundamentals,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. ""We believe that upsides do exist in Infosys and HCL Technologies but are wary of other names,"" it added.

Shares of Persistent Systems plunged 4.62 per cent to Rs 4,973.50. Coforge shares slipped 3.82 per cent to Rs 4,418. 40. Mphasis, Cyient and Zensar Technologies declined 3.71 per cent, 3.10 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively. LTIMindtree dropped 2.14 per cent to Rs 4,838. Among largecaps, Tech Mahindra also declined 2.20 per cent ti Rs 1,084. TCS fell 1.81 per cent while Infosys skidded 2 per cent. HCL Tech and WIpro declined 1.4 per cent each.

""Delays in client decision-making and pullbacks in discretionary spending have implications for the growth of Indian IT. We expect revenues in 1QFY24E to be weaker than 4QFY23 across companies in our coverage universe. We believe that the demand environment is especially weak in the financial services and technology segments. A prolonged recovery in clients’ willingness to spend would imply downside risks to FY2024 revenue growth estimates. Noting the weak demand, we are surprised by the rally in stock prices across our coverage in the past month,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The brokerage said Indian IT will benefit from cost take-out programs and mega-deals. However, these positives are outweighed by the broader caution in spending, especially in the impacted verticals, it said.

""SaaS and digital engineering companies’ commentary and revenue guidance suggests weak demand in the Jun’23 quarter with subsequent revival of demand in H2FY24/H2CY23 because, even though the sales cycle is lengthening, pipeline is not shrinking. Plus, there is demand from cost optimisation opportunities,"" said ICICIdirect.

This brokerage believes that weakness in revenue growth in 2023 is largely priced in the stock prices at current valuations, with Nifty IT index trading at 22 times one-year forward EPS, 2 epr cent premium to 5-year average PE.

""We continue to prefer Infosys (BUY) and Persistent Systems (BUY), followed by LTIMindtree (BUY) and TCS (BUY),"" it said.

102	DALBHARAT	Dalmia Bharat Ltd	Expects profitability to improve as operating cost normalise: Dalmia Bharat	"Cement maker Dalmia Bharat Ltd has said it expects the company's profitability to gradually improve as commodity inflation cools down.

Dalmia Bharat will also establish presence in the markets of western, mid and northern regions, emerging as a pan-India pure-play cement company, the company said in its annual report.

The company's profitability will gradually improve as the prices of crude and coal have corrected from their peak, resulting in normalisation in the operational costs, it added.

Dalmia Bharat is embracing strategies that will enable it to capitalise on the large opportunity and help double its market share over the next decade, it said



""We are more than doubling our capacity to 75 MTPA by 2027. Through this expansion, we aim to achieve a balance in our exposure mix to the different markets of India, which is currently tilted towards the east and the south,"" said Dalmia Bharat while sharing its outlook.

The company presently operates 14 plants in 10 states having a total production capacity of 38.6 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA). For the financial year ended on March 31, 2023, its revenue stood at Rs 13,540 crore.

""We are investing to expand continuously our cement production capacity. We plan to achieve this by adding greenfield units and accelerating existing plants. Our goal is to increase our cement production capacity from 38.6 MTPA to 46.6 MTPA in FY24, and we aim to acquire Jaypee's cement capacity to reach 56 MTPA by FY24,"" it said.

Last year, Dalmia Bharat had announced the acquisition of cement assets of Jaypee Group's flagship company JAL and its associate firm at an enterprise value of Rs 5,666 crore. The deal would help Dalmia Bharat, a leading maker in eastern part of the country, to expand presence in central India.

Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Managing Director & CEO Mahendra Singhi said the demand for cement remained strong at 10 per cent. However, the impact of high inflation resulted in a slightly subdued sentiment and exerted pressure on margins.

However, as the inflationary pressure cools down, he is now optimistic for a robust demand outlook.

""Looking forward we are optimistic about the future based on a robust demand outlook, steady cement prices and the peak of commodity price inflation behind us,"" said Singhi.

He further said: ""We expect profitability to gradually improve from here on, and we remain focused on delivering value to our stakeholders.""



According to the company, multiple factors such as Infrastructure push by the government and growing demand from the housing sector are driving the demand.

The central government increased capital outlay by 33 per cent to Rs 10 lakh crore in the Union Budget 2023-24. This is viewed as a boost to infrastructure and construction companies.

""Further, initiatives like National Infrastructure Pipeline and PM GatiShakti, among others, are likely to drive the construction activities in the country, fuelling demand for cement,"" it said.

The housing sector is also on a rebound in the post-pandemic era helped by increased preference towards home ownership, favourable interest rate regime and registration and stamp duty benefits offered by several state governments across the country.

""Further, the government's increased outlay towards 'Housing for All' provided fillip to housing demand in the country,"" it said.

India's estimated cement demand by FY27 would be 419.92 million tonnes, in which 27 per cent would be from infrastructure, 25 per cent from urban housing and 36 per cent from rural housing, it said.

""The much-awaited theme of industry consolidation has started to play out and we are witnessing waves of changes in the industry's operating dynamics,"" it said."	"Cement maker Dalmia Bharat Ltd has said it expects the company's profitability to gradually improve as commodity inflation cools down.

103	DEEPAKNTR	Deepak Nitrite Ltd	SRF, GFCL, Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine: How have they fared and which stock to buy?	"The past years have been transformational for speciality chemicals players, and the narrative in Q4FY23 results points to continued growth in some areas, while challenges are emerging in a few areas. Capex plans continue to be on the higher side, supported by past capex bearing results. New product lines and categories are being added across companies, but some existing lines may face volatility in the short term. We have analyzed the fourth quarter results of the five largest companies in the sector for a consolidated view.

Demand for value-added products

The big five – SRF, Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFCL), Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine – in order of market capitalization, have reported divergent revenue growth ranging from 5 to 70 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter. In SRF and Deepak Nitrite, which reported lower revenue growth, the main segments (speciality chemicals and phenols, respectively) continue to deliver double-digit growth with weakness in other segments, resulting in 5-6 per cent YoY growth on a consolidated basis.

Value-added products, including refrigerant gases, contractual products and downstream applications, reported strong demand visibility. Refrigerant gases gained from shortage-related price hikes in the past. But as developed markets phase out production and consumption, global demand for the same from Indian manufacturers should sustain. Companies offering contractual development (CDMO) – SRF and Navin, reported operationalising client/product-specific plants with visibility of continued additions into the future. Flourine-related chemistries spanning SRF, Navin and GFCL continue to have strong demand visibility.

On the contrary, industry-specific, commoditised product lines – textiles, packaging for SRF, dyes/pigments for Deepak Nitrite, consumer discretionary for Atul and Aarti or even generic agrochemical/pharma intermediaries manufacturers, reported a weak demand environment. High-interest rates, channel stocking or inventory rationalisation could be seen as a reason. While volume growth may be positive, pricing may remain weak through FY24. This should moderate consolidated margins in the short term from earlier higher levels.

Capex remains secularly high

Speciality chemicals, a capex-driven narrative, continue to be in a high investment mode. GFCL has added fluoropolymer lines and expects a significant contribution from FY25. The company is investing ₹1,000 - ₹1,500 crore per fiscal in FY22-24, and the capex will be focused on fluoropolymers. SRF will be operationalising its first line of fluoropolymers in H2FY24 and is eyeing products further down the line. New dedicated lines for advanced intermediaries in agrochem and pharma will be added along with new-age products for SRF. Navin expects a higher run rate of existing CDMO plants and expects to add furthermore. All three companies will add higher capacity for refrigerant gases, potentially leading to overinvestment in the space if the volume growth does not pan out (companies are confident of demand strength, though).

Deepak Nitrites is also eyeing capex of ₹2,500 crore over the next three years, which should improve its phenols business-related downstream applications and backward integration. Similarly, Tata Chemicals which also operates at the base chemicals level, plans on ₹2,000 crore capex for the next three years, which should improve soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and silica capacities. Similar to complex fluoropolymers of other companies, Tata Chemicals base products are also eyeing a multifold growth in solar, electric vehicle, fuel cells and other new age applications for growth in demand. On the other hand, capex plans of companies reliant on commoditised products, which are facing a short-term slowdown in demand, may face lower returns from invested capital if the slowdown extends beyond the short term.

The valuation range of the sector is wide, starting from 23 to 46 times FY24 earnings (excluding Tata Chemicals, which trades at ten times owing to its basic chemicals nature). The higher-than-market range (18-20 times FY24 earnings for Nifty) is owing to the capex mode the companies are in. We recently recommended investors accumulate SRF. Earlier, we also recommended investors buy GFCL stock when trading at₹2,770. The stocks are trading at reasonable multiples given growth prospects (23 times for GFCL and 30 times for SRF), operate at the upper end of the value chain, and invest in the right areas (away from consumer discretionary space facing lower demand). But one must constantly monitor the ‘new demand’ from Europe, import replacement, and new clients/products to justify the valuation range."

103	DEEPAKNTR	Deepak Nitrite Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.

The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.

""Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.

""The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,"" Shetti said.

The broader markets continued the uptrend for more than a couple of weeks now, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index up 0.14 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.36 percent.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty continued its uptrend for the second consecutive session and rose 164 points to 44,102, forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale making higher high and higher low formation, as the market participants were cautious ahead of the outcome of a three-day policy meeting by the RBI.

""The Bank Nifty index is expected to continue to trade within the range of 43,700-44,300. This suggests that the index is likely to move sideways, lacking a clear trend,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

However, he says that a break on either side of this range can lead to a directional move, potentially indicating a shift in the market sentiment and momentum.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,074, followed by 44,029 and 43,955, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,221, then 44,266, and 44,339.

Eleven non-F&O stocks are likely to be removed from the Nifty Next 50 index, if the exchange decides to tweak its computation methodology, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.

These 11 stocks are Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, Bajaj Holdings, Adani Green Energy, Zomato, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, P&G Hygiene, LIC and Adani Wilmar.

Currently, these 11 stocks command 9.05 percent weight in the Nifty Next 50 index. Nifty Next 50 represents the next rung of liquid securities after the Nifty 50.

""The exposure of the index to non-F&O stocks frequently hitting the price bands, lowers the ability to replicate the index portfolio efficiently and thus increases the tracking error,"" according to Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

Follow our live blog for all the market action

To resolve this, NSE Indices has floated a discussion paper and proposed that only stocks traded in the futures and options (F&O) segment be part of the index.

""Having only those stocks that are available for F&O trading into the Nifty Next 50 index shall improve the ease of replication of the index by passive funds,"" Pagaria said.

This could be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be implemented on June 30, these 11 stocks will see a reduction in their weight. From 9.05 percent, the cumulative weight for the non F&O stocks will come down to 5 percent.

In the second phase, to be implemented on September 30, the stocks will be deleted and a new set will be added.

""As of now, this is just a consultation and final implementation could be announced by exchange by third week of June,"" added Pagaria.

In the case of deletion, the 11 stocks that stand to get entry to Nifty Next 50 are Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent, Indian Hotels, TVS Motor Company, Cummins India, Jindal Steel and Power, Polycab, Punjab National Bank, Zydus Lifesciences and Abbott India.

Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent and Indian Hotels could see over $40 million of inflow due to this, according to Nuvama's calculations. These changes are key to tracking as many exchange-traded funds and index funds are benchmarked to it.

106	DELTACORP	Delta Corp Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"Trading

With the Nifty50 falling below the 18,600 mark on June 9, we saw selling pressure in equity benchmarks for yet another session as all sectors trended down, led by FMCG and IT.

The BSE Sensex dropped 223 points to 62,626, while the Nifty50 declined 71 points to 18,563, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts for the second straight session.

Overall, the Nifty is not displaying any major signs of weakness. However, ""at higher levels, signs of exhaustion are emerging, with negative divergence observed in momentum indicators, suggesting a potential for profit booking in the market,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

He feels the immediate and crucial support level stands at the 20-day moving average (DMA) of 18,450, and if breached, the next support level would be 18,180. On the upside, the 18,800-18,888 range is seen to be a resistance zone, he said.

Broader markets also trended downward, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling over one-tenth of a percent each on weak breadth, even as volatility remained lower levels. The India VIX closed at a one-and-half-month low (11.12), indicating that the market is more stable.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

According to the pivot point calculator, the Nifty may find support at 18,552, followed by 18,523 and 18,477. If the index advances, then 18,645 will be the key resistance, followed by 18,673 and 18,720.

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels in the later part of the session and ended the day 6.3 points down at 43,989, forming a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale.

""We expect the prices to oscillate within a broad horizontal range of 43,500-44,500. Currently, the index is trading above the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average), which aligns near 43,850.

112	CUB	City Union Bank Ltd	CUB likely to appoint Boston Consulting to upgrade digital-lending processes: MD	"June 05, 2023 09:53 pm | Updated 10:46 pm IST - CHENNAI

The City Union Bank (CUB) is likely to appoint Boston Consulting Group (BCG) for upgrading its digital-lending processes, said MD & CEO N. Kamakodi during an earnings call.

The move assumes significance as most of CUB’s peers had grown 14%-16% in the digital- lending space over the last 3-4 years, he added.

“Historically, we did not concentrate much on segments such as housing loans, credit cards, vehicle loans, personal loans, LAP as well as co-lending model.,” he said.

“Now, we could see that our peers are growing in these segments. Based on our learnings in the last 3-4 years, we are on the verge of finalising BCG, as our consultant to upgrade our existing digital-lending processes,” he added.

Accordingly, the private sector lender has shifted its attention towards retail products such as housing loans, vehicle loans, personal loans and loan against properties (LAP) as well as co-lending. For FY23, MSMEs accounted for 43% of the advances while gold loan stood at 25%.

“The approval proportion should progressively increase in the next few quarters. We are aiming at 12%-15% growth for the current year, which should be skewed towards year end. No major change is expected in composition of advances,” he said.

Asserting that the changeover might not happen during the current fiscal, he said: “So, I am not taking those things for my growth projections in the current year.”

According to him, FY23 had been a decent year of progress for CUB, despite the challenges. Most of the parameters such as net profit growth, reduction in non-performing asset and Return on Asset growth had been broadly in line on an annual basis while the growth was below the expectation levels.

The bank had estimated the slippage for FY23 to be in the range of 2.5%-3% of closing advances, but it ended at 3.02%. The bank expects substantial improvement in recovery in FY24 to get net NPA back to pre-Covid level in the coming 4-5 quarters, he said."

113	DMART	Avenue Supermarts Ltd	How BigBasket Is Trying To Retain Dominance Over DMart Ready, JioMart	"Tata Group-backed BigBasket has reduced the pricing gap with products offered by competitors like JioMart and DMart Ready as online grocers wrestle for a bigger share of inflation-wary consumers' weekly shopping.

BigBasket has narrowed prices with its peers on key products from butter and pulses to shampoos. Being the largest online retailer with three times the size of nearest competitor, that will significantly improve its consumer value proposition, increasing competition, Prabhudas Lilladher said in a June 8 note.

BigBasket's move underscores the competition in the tough grocery sector that accounts for two-thirds of India’s $836 billion retail market, led by the unorganised trade. While e-grocery is still a tiny accounting for 1%, Statista said urban Indians are addicted to online shopping, thanks to a year of intense marketing, big sales from e-tailers and the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns.

Consumers, however, are price conscious as well. More so as they cut down spending to counter inflation.

Prices were rising till February, when input began easing in key segments. Since then, BigBasket has raised prices of 24% of 125 products across categories like loose grocery items, dairy, packaged food, personal care, beverages and home care, according to an analysis by Prabhudas Lilladher. By comparison, JioMart raised prices of 32% and DMart of 30% of their products.

Online grocers increased prices on select products in May, but several products also became cheaper as raw material costs softened.

DMart Ready increased prices of 45% of the items in the loose grocery category over February, while JioMart hiked MRP on 45% such items, according to Prabhudas Liladher.

Bigbasket, however, cut prices on half of the loose grocery items, significantly reducing gap with peers. For example:"	"Tata Group-backed BigBasket has reduced the pricing gap with products offered by competitors like JioMart and DMart Ready as online grocers wrestle for a bigger share of inflation-wary consumers' weekly shopping.

116	DIXON	Dixon Technologies (India) Ltd	Visa delays for Chinese professionals hit India businesses	"The government's strict approval process for granting visas to Chinese nationals and clearing investment plans of Chinese firms is now hurting Indian businesses, with projects getting delayed or even scrapped, multiple industry executives told ET.Expansion projects of homegrown electronics contract manufacturers - including Dixon Technologies ' proposed ₹400-crore unit for manufacturing refrigerators - are impacted due to non-grant or delay in grant of visa to Chinese engineers, they said.Some of these companies are now sending their technical resources to China and Taiwan in order to get trained for skills like installation of manufacturing lines, executives said.""Companies, especially the production-linked incentive (PLI) holders, need some support from the government as far as clearance of visas for Chinese engineers is concerned,"" said Atul Lall , MD of Dixon Technologies.""We still need their (Chinese) technical expertise to build our plants and manufacturing infrastructure. Otherwise, this will hurt the Make in India ambitions and scaling up by companies,"" Lall said.The Tatas recently called off a proposed joint venture between the group's air-conditioner manufacturer Voltas and Chinese compressor manufacturer Highly International since the ""regulatory approvals were not forthcoming"", as Voltas said in a stock market notice.The joint venture was to invest about ₹500 crore to manufacture inverter AC compressors. Shanghai Highly Group is one of the largest compressor manufacturers in the world.Another major investment proposal for manufacturing expansion by a leading Chinese electronics company is yet to get the green light, people cited above said.Several leading Chinese smartphone brands don't have their India chief executive officers in the country for several months since their visas are not getting approved by the government. The list includes Vivo India CEO Jerome Chen, Oppo India CEO Elvis Zhou and sales director Chen Min, and Xiaomi's India head Alvin Tse.Chinese expat workforce in these companies is now almost one-third or even one-fourth of pre-Covid levels, industry executives said.These companies did not respond to emailed queries till press time Wednesday.Chief executives of some of the impacted companies said they are now required to regularly follow up on each Chinese visa application, including sending letters or meeting senior government officials.Chinese smartphone maker Realme 's president (international business) Madhav Seth said the government is evaluating each case of Chinese visa application individually.""The government wants companies in India to acquire and build skillsets to operate independently in the country,"" he added.However, executives said, building skills in India will take time and until then, Indian companies need support from companies and professionals in China and Taiwan, amongst others.Some pointed out that China is issuing visas liberally to Indian trade and industry, particularly after Covid-19 cases started to come down there.""We need to reciprocate similarly,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo , chairman of mobile phone and electronics manufacturers body India Cellular and Electronics Association .

Key risks: Since Signify is the company's largest customer, analysts warn that the former's market-share loss could curtail the latter’s offtake. That apart, delay in continuous customer on-boarding could curb growth prospects.

Meanwhile, here's what brokerages recommend for Ikio Lighting IPO:

Since Signify is the company's largest customer, analysts warn that the former's market-share loss could curtail the latter’s offtake. That apart, delay in continuous customer on-boarding could curb growth prospects.

Anand Rathi | Subscribe Analysts believe that the company's ability to offer end-to-end solutions and its backward-integrated manufacturing have resulted in a strong business model with healthy RoEs despite operating on a smaller base than its peers, which cater mainly to the mass-market needs of leading brands. They said that the stock trades at 54x 9MFY23 earnings-per-share (EPS) of Rs 5.3 at the upper price band.



ICICI Securities | Unrated The brokerage firm said that at the upper price band of Rs 285, the stock is priced at 32x FY23 annualised EPS of Rs 8.8/share. While analysts highlighted government incentives, China +1 strategy to drive the growth of LED lighting EMS (electronic manufacturing service) industry; the company's dependency on single product category and high dependency on imports for supply of raw materials can act as key risks.



Choice Equity | Subscribe Analysts assert that the company's peers operating in the EMS sector does not have similar business operations to it, and are considered only for valuation benchmarking. Ikio is demanding a P/E multiple of 43.6x (to its restated FY22 EPS of Rs. 6.5), compared to the peer average of 94.6x, they said. Based on FY23E earnings, the demanded P/E of 32.7x is at discount to peer’s prevailing trailing twelve months P/E multiple of 43.2x.

121	EMAMILTD	Emami Ltd	Emami expects 8-10% growth in FY24, driven by investments in start-ups and macro support	"Homegrown FMCG company Emami Ltd, which had seen its domestic business grow by around five per cent in the fourth quarter of FY-23, is expecting the growth momentum to improve to 8-10 per cent in 2023-24 driven by a mix of macroeconomic support and internal interventions including its investments in new age start-ups such as The Man Company and Brillare.

The company is also looking at close to 150 basis point expansion in gross margins in FY-24. Its gross margins expanded by around 60 basis points in the fourth quarter of FY-23 and stood at 63.1 per cent.

According to Mohan Goenka, Vice Chairman, Emami Ltd, though the summer has been a little weak, the company has witnessed some momentum from the rural markets.

“If the trend continues, we are very hopeful that it should be about 8-10 per cent growth for the domestic business. What is very, very heartening is that the input cost pressure has really eased and we are seeing margin expansion. So we would be able to put in some money on advertising on most of our categories,” Goenka said in the earnings call transcript uploaded on BSE.

The industry is experiencing a mixed-demand environment, and discretionary categories like personal care remain muted as consumers, especially in rural areas, are reducing nonessential expenditures. Inflation in rural areas reached 6.8 per cent in FY-23, the highest level in the previous nine years. Rural inflation surpassed urban inflation for the first time since FY-18. Additionally, excessive rainfall in many areas of the country in March impacted the demand for summer products, he said.

“With inflation moderating, the upcoming quarters look promising for the industry due to declining commodity prices, better monsoon, higher crop realization and continued government interventions,” he added.

Innovation in product portfolio

The company’s constant effort to innovate its product portfolio with a clear focus on digital first launches, and its sustained initiatives to ramp up the distribution network has augured well for the company. The company would continue to develop new products, particularly in the D2C space.

Emami launched around 20 products in FY23, the majority being digital first launches on the D2C portal Zandu Care. The recent launches contributed more than three per cent to its domestic sales in FY-23 and around 7 per cent to modern trade, and 20 per cent to e-commerce sales. The company has seen continued growth in modern trade and e-commerce for the several past quarters, and the trend continued in Q4, where modern trade grew by 18 per cent and e-commerce grew by 64 per cent, increasing their saliency to more than 20 per cent of domestic sales, a 500 basis point jump over the previous year.

The company continued its investments in Project Khoj, a rural expansion program and added close to 11,000 towns last year reaching around 52,000 towns and villages at the end of the last financial year. It plans to add another 8,000 towns and reach around 60,000 towns and villages by the end of FY-24.

123	EICHERMOT	Eicher Motors Ltd	Technical Analysis: Eicher Motors, Mahindra CIE Automotive, and Sharda Cropchem	"Eicher Motors (₹3,582.1)

Signs of a short-term fall

Eicher Motors’ stock, which took support at ₹2,850 in early April, has been on a rally since then. But after hitting the resistance at ₹3,700 three weeks ago, the stock lost momentum and started moving in a sideways trend. Notably, it declined last week, and the chart shows that the stock has formed an evening star candlestick pattern.

Considering this pattern and that there is a resistance at ₹3,700, the likelihood of a decline from here looks high. The price could possibly drop to ₹3,250. Hence, one can go short on Eicher Motors at the current level of ₹3,582. Add more shorts if the price inches up to ₹3,640. Place stop-loss at ₹3,800 initially. When the price falls below ₹3,400, alter the stop-loss to ₹3,525. Book profits at ₹3,250.

Mahindra CIE Automotive (₹506.6)

Shows good upward momentum

Mahindra CIE Automotive’s share price has been on a long-term uptrend. The latest leg of uptrend began in April at around ₹335. Last week, the stock showed good bullish momentum as it ended the week on a high note. It has closed above the key level of ₹500. Considering the prevailing price action, the likelihood of an extended rally from here is high.

Therefore, we recommend buying the stock of Mahindra CIE Automotive at the current level of about ₹507. Accumulate more shares if the price dips to ₹495. Keep initial stop-loss at ₹475. When the stock rallies to ₹540, exit half of the longs. For the remaining positions, revise the stop-loss up to ₹510. Liquidate the rest at ₹560.

Sharda Cropchem (₹555.8)

Breaches a key level

Sharda Cropchem’s stock has been largely tracing a sideways trend since the beginning of this year. That is, it was oscillating between ₹440 and ₹534. Last week, the stock garnered enough momentum leading to a decisive break out of the barrier at ₹534. This has opened the doors for further rally. Potentially, Sharda Cropchem’s share price can rise to ₹700 in the coming weeks.

Yet, there is a good chance for the stock to soften to ₹534 before the next leg of rally. So, go long now at ₹556 and add more longs if the price corrects to ₹534. Place stop-loss at ₹480 initially. Modify the stop-loss to ₹595 when the stock surpasses ₹625. Further, when the stock rallies past ₹660, tighten the stop-loss to ₹630. Exit at ₹690."

137	ENDURANCE	Endurance Technologies Ltd (CN)	Endurance Tech charts ₹800-cr capex in India and Europe on EV order surge	"Endurance Technologies Ltd intends to spend a capex of ₹350-400 crore in India and €40-45 million in Europe in FY24 as the auto parts manufacturer looks to ramp up capacity to meet the growing order flows.

The proposed capex in India will be similar to the FY23 capex of ₹391 crore, while the capex in Europe will be higher than last year’s €29.9 million.

The bulk of this fiscal’s capex in India (about 75 per cent) will be in growth projects and die-casting, while the remaining will be in R&D, quality/efficiency enhancement and routine replacements. The capex in Europe will be made in expanding capacity to meet new business requirements.

The company is expandingAnti-lock Braking Systemcapacity to 6 lakh units from 4 lakh units. Forging capacity is being ramped up to 6 lakh units from 2.8 lakh units. While it will establish a new assembly line for scooter front forks, it will also build casting and machining capability centres for electric vehicles and ICE orders. A new SMT line for the battery management system is expected to commence operations at Waluj, Aurangabad next month.

Indian EV orders

The company has bagged Indian EV orders worth ₹600 crore in the past two years from companies such as Bajaj, Ampere, Mahindra, Bounce, Hero Electric, Ather and Okinawa. Further, ₹329-crore EV business was won by its subsidiary Maxwell. In FY23, the company won orders for 15 EV programmes from 11 customers.

“While economies and automotive markets globally have seen turmoil in the form of the pandemic, inflation, geopolitics and supply chain issues, we at Endurance have benefited from our resilient structure and have moved from strength to strength in establishing ourselves as a strong and reliable partner for multiple marquee OEMs,” Satrajit Ray, Director & Group CFO of Endurance, told businessline.

Endurance Technologies is also in discussion with various customers for RFQs worth ₹2,600 crore.

In Europe, it bagged orders worth €84 million in FY23, of which €41 million were for EVs and €27 million for hybrid vehicles. Overall, the company secured orders worth €220 million from Europe in the last 4 years, of which €71 million were for EVs and €112 million for hybrid applications.

Since Europe is a large market for e-bikes, the company believes that its recent initiatives to set up a 2W Centre of Excellence in Europe (though acquisitions of Adler, Grimeca, Frenotecnica and Newfen in the last 3-4 years) will help access this market in a more significant way.

While the company doesn’t give any growth guidance, it is confident of growing ahead of the industry. The company posted a consolidated total income of ₹8849.5 crore for FY23, up 17 per cent from ₹7590.2 crore in FY22. Its PAT (after minority interest) was ₹480 crore, up from ₹461 crore."

138	FDC	F D C Ltd	‘Ban on 14 FDC drugs unlikely to impact consumers’	"The Centre’s ban on 14 fixed-dose-combination (FDC) drugs is being accepted across pharmaceutical and civil society lines, as it comes after a long drawn battle to clear the market off “irrational and unscientific” medicines.

An FDC involves a combination of two or more medicines in a single product with fixed dosages. But the Centre’s latest move is unlikely to impact consumers, as this deliberation has been underway for about 15 years now, through multiple litigation and expert committees, industry voices told businessline. Companies have since moved to alternate formulations, they add, since the government’s overall direction was clear through the years.

Late last week, the Centre banned 14 FDCs from manufacture and distribution, harking back to an expert committee finding that they had “no therapeutic justification” and may in fact “involve risk to human beings”. The FDCs included those used to treat fever and infections. They included nimesulide+paracetamol dispersible tablets; Amoxicillin+bromhexine; Chlopheniramine maleate + Codine syrup, to name just a few combinations. And representatives with domestic and multinational companies said off record that the government’s latest directive was along expected lines and they had shifted to alternative products.

Backstory

Explaining the backdrop to the latest directive, an All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) statement said: “The Supreme Court, as part of its December 2017 order, had also agreed on the request of some companies, that the March 2016 ban on 344 + 5 FDCs will not apply to 15 FDCs approved before Sept 1988.”

The third expert committee also affirmed “that 12 of the 15 pre-1988 FDCs were fit for ban”, the note said, and this was the basis of the total on 14 FDCs.

S Srinivasan, Aidan co-convenor and with Locost (a maker of essential drugs), was among the early interveners supporting the government ban. “These FDCs are irrational and unscientific, the expert committees have said clearly. Most of the affected manufacturers were not able to prove the therapeutic rationale, safety and efficacy of their FDCs,” he said.

The Aidan statement said: “It also shows that our regulators can undo wrong decisions of the past, if they put their heart to it. In this case the push came from the plain talking 59th Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).”"	"The Centre’s ban on 14 fixed-dose-combination (FDC) drugs is being accepted across pharmaceutical and civil society lines, as it comes after a long drawn battle to clear the market off “irrational and unscientific” medicines.

140	EXIDEIND	Exide Industries Ltd	Amara Raja Batteries (ARBL) Stock: A Value Pick with Growth Potential	"The Nifty auto index is touching all-time highs and the Nifty has also rebounded close to its peak seen in December 2022. However, there are still some pockets of opportunity left in the markets. The stock of Amara Raja Batteries (ARBL) is one such. At ₹625 now, it is at a 44.5 per cent discount to its all-time high touched in 2015. At 15 times trailing 12-month earnings, it is much cheaper than peer Exide Industries trading at about 20 times. ARBL has corrected since December 2022, where it touched one-year high of ₹668 alongside the broader market peak.

The electric vehicle (EV) narrative has been a big dampener for battery makers in the last few years as their core product, i.e. lead acid batteries for vehicles, will be replaced by lithium ion ones in EVs.

EV sales too have caught on in a big way since the pandemic, with FY23 seeing a 157 per cent growth in sale of registered EVs to about 11.8 lakh units. ARBL’s failure to qualify for PLI for the manufacture of ACC batteries has been another negative. However, the fear may be overdone. For one, EV sales constitute just 5.5 per cent of the conventional vehicle sales in FY23 and the path to reduce vehicular emissions is also surrounded by policy uncertainties.

Secondly, battery makers are not dependent on new vehicle sales alone as there is a recurring replacement demand for batteries from existing vehicles. Thus, the existing population of on road vehicle needs to be serviced till end of life, even if some of the incremental new vehicle sales move to EVs. Three, ARBL is also investing in manufacturing lithium batteries with an initial 2Gwh cell capacity and 2Gwh pack capacity expected by FY25 and a peak cell capacity of 16Gwh expected by FY32. Four, industrial batteries (30 per cent of revenues) provide the needed diversification from the cyclical auto industry. In this segment, ARBL has a 60 per cent market share in telecom batteries, where volumes are being supported by the 5G rollout.

Considering these factors, investors with an appetite for risk and a long-term perspective can buy the shares.

Game plan

Currently, ARBL derives almost two-thirds of its revenues from automotive batteries (lead acid) and in that, predominantly from four-wheelers and the replacement markets (see chart). After two years of double-digit growth each, SIAM, the industry body, expects growth in new car sales volumes to moderate to 5-7 per cent year-on-year in FY24. However, robust new car sales in the last 2-3 years imply that the replacement demand for these vehicles would hold the fort for ARBL in the near to medium term, when cyclicality in new vehicle kicks in. Usually, companies also have good margins in the replacement segment. While sale to OEMs will moderate, the company still expects it to be in high single digits.

What holds promise for ARBL for the long term is its new energy business. In FY23, about ₹250 crore of revenues came from sale of packs and chargers under this business, predominantly to three-wheelers and the telecom segment. This business fetches 3-4 per cent EBIDTA margins now and the company is aiming to touch ₹750 crore revenues in FY24, having roped in two-wheeler OEMs for commercial supplies recently. For perspective, two-wheelers are the largest selling EVs in the country, constituting about 60 per cent of the total EV sales today. While there are some headwinds to electric 2-wheeler sales today from the subsidy cuts by the government, adoption is still expected to be faster here than other segments.

ARBL will hold the new energy business through 100 per cent subsidiaries. Amara Raja Advanced Cell Technologies will hold the upcoming Lithium battery capacities at Divitipally in Telangana and the battery packs. Amara Raja Power Systems, which manufactures chargers, was held by promoters and ARBL acquired it recently for a cash consideration of ₹133 crore. The company had ₹184 crore of revenues, EBITDA Margin of 11.12 per cent and PBT margin of 17.4 per cent in FY23. For lithium cell technology, in-house R&D as well as investments made in a few tech companies such as Log 9 are expected to provide support. Homologation process with customers is on the anvil. On the raw material side, a 25 per cent domestic value addition is expected initially. For these plans, a total of ₹1,300 crore capex is estimated over the next 2-2.5 years and will be financed with internal accruals as well as some leverage on ARBL. The debt-to-equity ratio for ARBL is now at a comfortable 0.03.

Financials

ARBL has seen double-digit sales and profit growth in the last few quarters, with reported profits in the latest quarter growing by 40 per cent year-on-year to ₹138 crore ( adjusted profits grew by 74 per cent to ₹171 crore). Sales in Q4 grew by 11.4 per cent to ₹2,429 crore. Operating margins compressed to 9.9 per cent in Q1, following the shooting up of lead prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. While margins expanded to 13 and 15 per cent respectively in Q2 and Q3, it has again compressed a bit to 11.9 per cent in Q4, with lead prices hardening. The company expects lead prices to stabilise around the current $2,000 per tonne levels.

In September 2022, the company announced a backward integration plan with respect to plastic component for batteries, which would result in margin expansion of 75 to 100 bps for ARBL. That said, as the new energy business begins scaling up, margin pressures at the consolidated level could come into the picture until these operations achieve economies of scale.

146	GLENMARK	Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The market has seen a correction for the first time in the last five consecutive sessions on June 8, after the RBI Monetary Policy Committee unanimously held the repo rate at 6.5 percent, in line with consensus expectations while retaining the withdrawal of accommodation stance by five out of six votes. Most of the sectors, barring metal, saw correction.

The BSE Sensex fell 294 points to 62,849, while the Nifty50 declined 92 points to 18,635 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, which experts feel is the short-term reversal of the trend.

""A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with an upper shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates rejection of bulls at the highs and this could be considered as a short-term reversal pattern on the downside,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He feels Thursday's swing high could be considered as a new higher top of the sequence and further weakness for the short term is expected to be a higher bottom of the sequence.

At the lows, Nifty could find cluster support like ascending trendline, 10-day and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) around 18,560-18,450 levels, he said.

The broader markets also snapped rallies of several sessions as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 0.55 percent and 0.95 percent, respectively.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

The Nifty may get support at 18,614 followed by 18,576 and 18,514. If the index advances, then 18,738 will be the key resistance followed by 18,776 and 18,838.

Nifty Bank

We have also seen a correction in the Bank Nifty, which fell 280 points to 43,995 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily scale, following the RBI policy.

""In terms of support levels, the index has a support level positioned at 43,700. A breach below this support level might indicate a further downside potential and could attract additional selling interest from traders and investors,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

The index is stuck in a range and a break on either side will have a directional move, he feels.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 43,917, followed by 43,790 and 43,583, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,331, then 44,459 and 44,665.

Call options data

154	GODREJPROP	Godrej Properties Ltd	Indian economy is on a strong footing: Siddhartha Khemka	"""To top it all, we had the corporate earnings , which was kind of a four quarter high growth in terms of earnings. Margins have started improving, raw material costs have come down and corporates have been able to pass on the price hikes because of the earlier raw material price that had gone up,"" says Siddhartha Khemka , Head of Retail Research, MOSL.I think if you look at overall markets, we have seen a lot of strength both in the domestic as well as global markets and that is on back of the strong macro that we have seen, especially for the Indian economy GDP growth surprised everyone, GST collections continue to see strong uptick and other smaller macro data points also.So for example, the gross total tax collections data came in yesterday, which also implied some improvement in the overall movement. You also look at the power consumption, which is at eight year high. All these trends definitely indicate that the Indian economy is on a strong footing.To top it all, we had the corporate earnings , which was kind of a four quarter high growth in terms of earnings. Margins have started improving, raw material costs have come down and corporates have been able to pass on the price hikes because of the earlier raw material price that had gone up.So the overall net-net, while the short term movement would be volatile given the sharp up move that we have seen in April and May, but the overall view continues to remain very positive.If you look at Nifty, it touched 18,600 first time in October 2021. And we are now back to same levels after almost 18, 19 months. So the one year forward PE for Nifty has corrected from 23, 24 to now about 18, 19 times, which is much more comfortable.And given that FY23, the overall corporate earnings and Nifty earnings grew at 11% after almost 35, 36% growth in FY22.And on back of this, we are now expecting about 15 to 18% earnings growth for FY24. So the earnings growth trajectory is good. FY23, we saw a lot of global macro headwinds, starting with the Ukraine war, then the commodity price inflation.And then to top it all, we had the interest rate hike cycle. So luckily for us, all these are now turning in favour. The commodity prices have come down, inflation is under control. And now we are looking at a situation where central banks are taking a pause before they start lowering the interest rates.Definitely banking and finance has been leading from the front but I think auto is one sector which has definitely done the bulk of the batting in this quarter. And the highest upgrade that we have seen, especially in the large capital, if you look at the Nifty 50 companies, Tata Motors is where we have done bulk of earnings upgrade.We are seeing the company benefiting from all round growth across the segments and the company has been generating a lot of cash flows. They are looking at reducing the debt. All the three business segments are doing well. The domestic CV cycle is looking at a recovery or growth in the CV cycle in India. The passenger vehicle business is doing well on back of new launches. The EV penetration, Tata Motors has almost 80% market share in the PV electric vehicle segment and the global JLR that also is benefiting from improvement in the supply of the semiconductors, improvement in demand, and also penetration of EVs.So I think that is one space, the entire auto space, where I think a lot of upgrades and positive news flows will keep coming in, numbers will keep coming in, which would be surprising on the positive side, where Tata Motors is kind of leading from the front.Yes, so if you look at the FMCG index, it was the first index to cross its previous highs and make new highs. And rightly so because the sector definitely benefited out of the fall in the raw metal prices, especially some of the consumption items. And there was, as you rightly highlighted, the points which were expected to improve growth.And in the quarterly management commentaries also we heard how sequentially the demand is kind of coming back.So one weak spot was the rural consumption demand which was expected to get improved after the monsoon. So while IMD has been reiterating that there will be a normal monsoon, there are definitely risks because of the El Nino factor and with the US agency now highlighting that this year could be a year of El Nino.And rightly so, we are seeing the stocks in FMCG sectors getting booked, especially from the short-term traders. Overall I think the consumption demand is definitely set to improve not only for some of the staples but also for the overall discretionary space.We are seeing that in the auto sector, some of the consumption discretionary items, as well as in the retail space. We are seeing how the demand is coming back and how numbers are likely to improve for some of the retail consumption themes, some of the QSRs.So within that space, we just recently upgraded Avenue Supermarket from neutral to buy rating.We believe that there is a long runway for growth in the retail space. The company has utilised this time to expand its store footprint and will benefit the most when the demand comes back.The company has very good financials because of the weak same-store sales where the stock had underperformed and valuations from its peak has definitely come down. So overall we are expecting D-Mart revenue and PAT, CAGR of 27 and 29% over the next two years and because of the good cash flows that they are going to generate, we see a 16% growth in the retail footprint which should drive the stock from here on.I think yes, definitely there is some momentum that we saw in the textile players. We generally have a few of the home textile players under our coverage, not the entire textile sector as a whole. Within that also we have, say for example, we like Trident which is a small cap company, we have a buy rating on that. If you look at the overall home textile segment, demand was kind of pushed back because of the key markets of US and Europe facing the slowdown and the recessionary pressures there.Which is bulk of that is now factored in with now the raw material, the cotton prices coming down, they would benefit to some extent on the margins front. So I think yes, one can look at selectively in some of the textile names from here on as well.Yes, so I think if you look at the entire real estate pack the sector has been doing well and company after company had reported record pre-sales numbers which also got reflected into the financials. Luckily you see the stock prices had moved up earlier and because of the interest rate hike cycle, the sector had kind of underperformed in the last couple of months.But now with the RBI taking a pause and a likely pause by the US Fed, I think the interest rate looks to remain benign going forward, which should aid the overall sentiments for the real estate space. Demand which was initially very strong and people were thinking that it is a pent-up demand after the COVID has fortunately sustained even after that.And that is where we are seeing that record pre-sales data coming out company after company. What has also helped is that the supply discipline that the large players have maintained over this period despite the improving demand, supply has been very gradual and consistent just to meet the incremental demand.Overall we have been positive. We have recently upgraded Godrej Properties , we feel that the valuations are comfortable. We continue to like Macro Developers which is a large player in the Mumbai region, continues to do well and we see strong growth there. So these two are, you can say, our preferred picks within the overall real estate space."	"""To top it all, we had the corporate earnings , which was kind of a four quarter high growth in terms of earnings.
All these trends definitely indicate that the Indian economy is on a strong footing.To top it all, we had the corporate earnings , which was kind of a four quarter high growth in terms of earnings.

155	HAL	Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"Trading

With the Nifty50 falling below the 18,600 mark on June 9, we saw selling pressure in equity benchmarks for yet another session as all sectors trended down, led by FMCG and IT.

The BSE Sensex dropped 223 points to 62,626, while the Nifty50 declined 71 points to 18,563, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts for the second straight session.

Overall, the Nifty is not displaying any major signs of weakness. However, ""at higher levels, signs of exhaustion are emerging, with negative divergence observed in momentum indicators, suggesting a potential for profit booking in the market,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

He feels the immediate and crucial support level stands at the 20-day moving average (DMA) of 18,450, and if breached, the next support level would be 18,180. On the upside, the 18,800-18,888 range is seen to be a resistance zone, he said.

Broader markets also trended downward, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling over one-tenth of a percent each on weak breadth, even as volatility remained lower levels. The India VIX closed at a one-and-half-month low (11.12), indicating that the market is more stable.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

According to the pivot point calculator, the Nifty may find support at 18,552, followed by 18,523 and 18,477. If the index advances, then 18,645 will be the key resistance, followed by 18,673 and 18,720.

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels in the later part of the session and ended the day 6.3 points down at 43,989, forming a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale.

""We expect the prices to oscillate within a broad horizontal range of 43,500-44,500. Currently, the index is trading above the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average), which aligns near 43,850. A significant breach below this EMA level would strengthen the possibility of further decline towards 43,500,"" said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President at Master Capital Services.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to find support at 43,937, followed by 43,870 and 43,760, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,157, then 44,225 and 44,335.

155	HAL	Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd	GE engine deal with Hindustan Aeronautics will have ripple effect across the US and Indian defense industries, says USIBC head	"A deal between General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to co-manufacture jet engines in India will have a ""ripple effect"" across the American and Indian defence industries, the head of a top US business advocacy group has said. The two companies are expected to announce the deal in this regard in and around the official State visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US on June 22.The two sides remain tight lipped about it as the industry experts are hopeful that the long-awaited deal would have a major impact on the relationship between the two nation.""Both governments are putting enormous effort into concluding the deal. I wish them great success. I hope it goes through. I think it will have a ripple effect across the US and Indian defence industries, and most importantly our private sector companies. (It) will unleash even more confidence and even more deal making. That leads to strong defence, which is deterrence, which means peace and security,"" Atul Keshap , president of US Indian Business Council , told PTI in an interview.He stressed that such an agreement between the two countries would be a pretty important deal.""I don't want to reveal conversations I've had in both governments, but one person told me that if this deal were to go through, it would impact the US India defence relationship for four decades in a positive way,"" Keshap said.""When you think about the scale of the engines, it's hundreds of them going into India's advanced multi role combat aircraft. It would involve a collaboration closer than we've ever had, and it would go on for many decades because those airplanes will be bought by the Indian taxpayer and expected to fly for 40 years as ours do,"" he said.He praised the possible deal.""Our planes fly longer and longer because we do avionics upgrades and capability upgrades, weapons systems, engine upgrades. So I think what India's doing or hoping to do is to get an even more powerful and performative engine into its next platform. And we support that,"" Keshap said.Responding to a question, Keshap said that Prime Minister Modi's administration has put enormous effort into ease of doing business in India and clearing up the regulatory environment and making India a more attractive destination.""Think about the fact that we are now solid Quad partners. The Quad is really important so that the US and India and Japan and Australia are investing so heavily in the Quad is a reflection of how much we trust each other and how much we have overcome the legacy of distrust in various areas. The nuclear deal was essential to unlock the Quad. ... I feel like strategically we're doing really well. When you look at the Quad, you look at military defense, military intelligence, diplomatic engagement, law enforcement, counterterrorism, things are very strong. Also, scientific collaboration, very, very strong,"" he said.According to Keshap , the ICET (Initiative of Critical and Emerging Technology) is as important as the nuclear deal in unleashing that next big arena of US-India, deep tech, future tech cooperation.""We've learned from the pandemic that we trust each other, that we're willing to do the most sensitive things with each other with regard to technology. That also kind of implies there are people we don't trust, and we want to keep our channel clean in a high trust ecosystem. So strategy is good, the economy is getting better, and technology is now beginning in earnest. That's the main theme of this visit (of the prime minister to India),"" he said."

157	GREENPANEL	Greenpanel Industries Ltd	Up to 50% upside potential! Analysts bullish on these 3 underperforming stocks	"India’s top wood panel firms including Greenply Industries, Greenpanel Industries, and Century Plyboards (India) reported a mixed set of financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Shares of these companies have underperformed the benchmark equity index during the past one year.

With a rally of 4.45 per cent, Century Plyboards (India) emerged as the top gainer in the list. The scrip rose to Rs 579.95 on Friday from Rs 555.20 a year earlier. Greenpanel Industries and Greenply Industries plunged 30.62 per cent and 9.99 per cent, respectively, during the same period. On the other hand, the BSE Sensex advanced 13 per cent during that period.

However, ICICI Securities is optimistic about the wood panel segment driven by a continued uptick in real estate, growing consumer preference for organised players and reasonable valuations. “We have a ‘Buy’ rating on all the stocks under our coverage. We continue to prefer Greenpanel Industries and Century Plyboards in the wood panel industry led by their leadership position in their core categories,” the brokerage said in a report.

Of late, Century Plyboards (India) (CPBI) posted 29.48 per cent YoY growth in net profit at Rs 114.66 crore in Q4FY23. The company’s gross sales increased 7.15 per cent YoY to Rs 965.45 crore during the quarter under review. The bottom line of Greenpanel Industries and Greenply Industries declined 14.48 per cent YoY and 61.80 per cent YoY during the January-March quarter.

Brokerage YES Securities has a ‘Buy’ rating on Greenply Industries (GPIL) with a target price of Rs 250, indicating an upside of over 50 per cent from the current market price.

“GPIL is embarking on a strong growth trajectory wherein we reckon plywood biz to grow by 6 per cent over FY23-FY25 with margins coming in at 10.5 per cent in FY24 and FY25 respectively. MDF will boost performance from FY24 and we expect revenue from this segment to come in at Rs 270 crore and Rs 390 crore in FY24 and FY25, respectively. With major capex behind and debt likely to get repaid from FY24 and ROE and ROCE to improve to 20 per cent and 26 per cent respectively by FY25, we believe GPIL is available at lucrative valuations,” YES Securities said.

Systematix Institutional Equities is positive on Greenpanel Industries with a target price of Rs 439. Shares of the company traded at Rs 330 on June 9.

“We like Greenpanel for its market leadership in the fast-growing MDF industry (finding support from the rising acceptance, strong demand revival in housing units and readymade furniture) and robust financials,” Systematix Institutional Equities said in a report.

In Q4FY23, Greenpanel Industries witnessed an MDF revenue decline of 1 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 31.9 per cent) as blended realisation declined 10.2 per cent YoY (due to a higher share of exports which has lower realisation), while blended volume grew 10.2 per cent YoY (driven by 89.1 per cent YoY growth in exports; domestic volume declined 7.4 per cent YoY). CPBI’s MDF revenue also declined 1.1 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 20.6 per cent) as volume declined 2.8 per cent YoY (4-year CAGR of 7.2%) and realisation increased 1.5 per cent YoY.

As per government data, MDF import volume increased around 234 per cent and 41 per cent YoY and QoQ in Q4FY23, respectively, while realisation fell 37 per cent and 12 per cent YoY and QoQ, respectively. Thailand (35 per cent), Vietnam (30 per cent) and Malaysia (19 per cent) were the top contributors to import volume in Q4FY24.

Per industry participants, furniture demand in the US and Europe was subdued in the past few quarters, resulting in MDF exports from Southeast Asian countries being diverted to other regions (including India). The average monthly run-rate of imports in Q4FY23 (21,944 MT per month) was near the pre-Covid levels of FY19 (22,525 MT per month), which is expected to pose near-term demand and pricing headwinds for domestic players (as landed cost of imports is 20 per cent lower than domestic brands).

“MDF prices in international markets have seen an increase of 7–8 per cent so far in Q1FY24, which, if sustained, may result in lower imports in domestic markets going ahead. For FY24, CPBI has guided for 30 per cent YoY volume growth (enabled by capacity expansion) and 20 per cent EBITDA margin, while Greenpanel has guided for 12-15 per cent YoY volume growth (with a continued focus on driving export volume growth) and 23-25 per cent margins,” ICICI Securities said.

Nuvama maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on CPBI last month with a target price of Rs 675. Shares of the company traded at Rs 579 on June 9. “CPBI’s expansion plans across all segments are on track. Despite near-term demand and margin headwinds (due to higher inflation and rising timber prices), we expect the margin to stabilise in FY24, as timely price hikes and falling chemical prices should aid the margin. We are optimistic about its long-term growth prospects due to its diverse product portfolio, extensive distribution, and strong brand,” Nuvama said in a report.

167	GRAPHITE	Graphite India Ltd	Graphite India shares: Two factors why the stock is likely to touch Rs 440-mark	"Shares of Graphite India Ltd are in focus today as ICCI Direct sees 17% upside in the stock of the graphite electrode manufacturer. It has maintained a buy call on Graphite India with a target of Rs 440.

Graphite India stock ended 0.81% lower at Rs 372.15 in the previous trading session on BSE. Stock of Graphite India has lost 16.28% in a year and down 0.32% in 2023.

Total 1.01 lakh shares of the firm changed hands amounting to a turnover of Rs 3.75 crore on BSE. Market cap of the firm fell to Rs 7270.90 crore on Tuesday.

In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of the stock stands at 72.6, signaling the stock is trading in the overbought zone. Graphite India has a one-year beta of 1.1, indicating high volatility during the period. Graphite India shares are trading higher than the 5 day, 20 day, 50 day, 100 day and 200 day moving averages.

The brokerage sees two triggers in the future stock performance of Graphite India.

1. World Steel Association (WSA) forecasts that in CY23, steel demand will see a 2.3% rebound to reach 1822 million tonnes (MT) during CY23 and the demand forecast is expected to grow by 1.7% to reach 1854 MT by 2024. This augurs well for graphite electrodes demand

2. Steel manufacturers are shifting towards the EAF process, which is expected to drive sustainable demand for graphite electrodes in the long term. The EAF process is considered to be more environmentally friendly than traditional steel production methods, making it an attractive option for companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint.

Select analysts are positive on stocks including Hindalco Industries, Minda Corp and GNA Axles. Traders can initiate positions in these stocks on a positional basis to earn a decent profit in the medium term. Here's what Prabhudas Lilladher and ICICI Direct suggest for these stocks:



GNA Axles | Buy | Target Price: Rs 870-900 | Stop Loss: Rs 725

GNA Axles after the significant erosion witnessed has shown signs of bottoming out near the important 200-DMA with currently indicating a positive bullish candle with improving bias and is anticipated to rise further in the coming days. The RSI has shown a trend reversal from the consolidation phase to signal a buy and has much upside potential visible to carry on the momentum still further ahead. We suggest buying and accumulate the stock for an upside target of Rs 870-900 levels keeping Rs 725 as the stop loss level.

Recommended by: Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher



Minda Corp | Buy in Rs 290-296 | Target Price: Rs 319 | Stop Loss: Rs 279

The share price of Minda Corp has generated a breakout out above last 1 year range (Rs 287-185) with strong volume of more than three times the 50 days average volume of 11 lakhs share per day signaling extension of the up move and offers fresh entry opportunity. Key observation on the long-term chart is that the stock has witnessed a faster retracement of 11 months decline (Rs 287-185) in just 2 months signaling inherent strength and a robust price structure. We expect the stock to extend up move and head towards Rs 319 levels in the coming weeks being the price 123.6 per cent external retracement of last one-year corrective decline(Rs 287-185). Among the oscillators, the weekly 14 periods RSI is in uptrend sustaining above its nine-period average thus validates positive bias.

Hindalco Industries | Buy | Target Price: Rs 470 | Stop Loss: Rs 400

Hindalco after forming a strong base near the 400 zone, had a decent pullback, and recently, after a short correction, it has consolidated and is near the long-term trend line support zone. The RSI is also well placed, and after the short dip, it has indicated a trend reversal with improving bias and has upside potential to anticipate a further rise in the coming days. We suggest buying and accumulating this stock for an upside target of 470 while keeping the stop loss at 400.

171	HDFC	Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd	HDFC Defence Fund stops lump sum investments, restricts SIPs to Rs 10,000	"HDFC Mutual Fund has announced the discontinuation of lump sum subscriptions and restrictions on systematic transactions in its recently launched HDFC Defence Fund from June 12, 2023, citing the limited number of defence sector stocks.

Analysts say that while defence spending across the globe, including India, is rising, the limited pool of listed companies in the country that have relatively higher valuations is one of the challenges investors may face.

According to the HDFC MF press note, regarding the HDFC Defence Fund, it has decided that fresh lump sum investments (including switch-ins) will be discontinued. This means you cannot make fresh lump sum investments. Second, fresh SIP registrations (including SIP top up) only under monthly frequency shall be registered for up to Rs 10,000 per investor (aggregated at first holder PAN level). This means the restrictions on SIP will be applicable on the first PAN holder. Third, no new systematic transfers (STPs) into the scheme shall be registered.

Investors should also note that there are no restrictions on redeeming money from the scheme. According to the HDFC press note, “Systematic transactions registered prior to the effective date shall continue to be processed. Further, there shall be no restrictions on redemptions. All other terms and conditions, as mentioned in the scheme information document (SID) / key information memorandum (KIM) of the scheme, will remain unchanged.”

HDFC Defence Fund

The scheme was launched on May 19, 2023, and its new fund offer (NFO) period ended on May 30. It was launched to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing predominantly in equity and equity-related securities of companies in defence and allied sectors. The fund manager of the scheme is Abhishek Poddar, and it was categorised under thematic/sectoral fund. The benchmark for fund is Nifty India Defence Index TRI (total returns index).

Investors must know that it is a highly risky fund before considering investing. According to the HDFC website, the investment period should be more than 3 years if you are investing in such a scheme. The fund is suitable for wealth creation.

Key risks

Indian and Foreign government policies have large ramifications for the sector.

Buyer concentration risk: Government of India is a large buyer as it looks to meet the requirements of the defence forces.

Concentration risk: The upper ceiling on investments made is in accordance with their weighting in the Nifty India Defence Index or 10 per cent of the NAV of the scheme, whichever is higher.

Stocks within the portfolio could display correlation as they relate to the same sector and face similar risks."

171	HDFC	Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd	MPC may not go for rate cut before February 2024: HDFC Securities	"RBI

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities

The RBI MPC left the repo rates unchanged at 6.5 percent at its meeting on June 08, as the Street had expected. The MPC continued with the ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ stance, as liquidity has turned into a significant surplus mode, further increased by the impact of deposits of Rs 2000 notes.

A change in policy stance at this juncture might not be in sync with the current liquidity conditions. Headline CPI is still higher than the medium-term target of 4 percent, even on a 12-month forecast horizon. A sustained moderation in inflation may prompt the shift from a “withdrawal of accommodation” to a “neutral” stance.

Although the market is divided about the future course of action of FOMC; we believe we are on a prolonged pause in India (unless there are some external shocks, EL Nino conditions surfacing, etc).

India’s retail inflation eased to 4.7 percent YoY in April 2023 (18-month low) on account of the high base effect supported by softening in overall food prices. Trends for May suggest inflation could ease further, which can be seen from the sharp downward revision of the Q1FY24 inflation forecast by the RBI. The impact of the favourable (high) base effect on inflation is likely to continue in the coming few months; gradually bringing the inflation reading down in the absence of any external or internal supply shocks.

Also read: RBI likely to pause rate hikes through FY24 given the inflation trajectory, says Yes Bank Chief Economist

The IMD has retained its long-range forecast for the southwest monsoon at 96 percent of the LPA, implying normal monsoons. But there is a high probability of El Nino developing during the latter part of the monsoon. Although El Nino episodes in the past have not always led to a substantial rise in food inflation, this cannot be ruled out.

Moreover, risk could arise from output cuts by OPEC+ and its impact on imported inflation due to a rise in global crude oil prices. Geo-political disruption and the consequent impact on global commodity prices are other risks for inflation.

Notably, input price pressures have receded sharply (WPI below zero), hinting at the possibility of core goods CPI moderating, and services inflation also remaining soft. Given the uncertainties around the prevalence of El-Nino conditions leading to sub-par monsoon in 2023; RBI remained cautious and revised the inflation projection down by only 10bps to 5.1 percent for FY24.

Normalisation of the base, slowing external demand, and uncertain financial conditions would take real GDP growth to 6.5 percent in FY24 (RBI projection). Weaker global growth, lagged impact of RBI’s rate hikes and the development of El-Nino conditions during the monsoon season are the critical risks to GDP growth in FY24.

Headline inflation across countries is on a downward trajectory, but is still high and above the targets. Longer than expected rate hikes would increase the interest rate differential, making things difficult for emerging markets' central banks like RBI to cut rates in the near term.

We think the central bank seems to have fewer concerns about growth rather than around the inflation outlook. This was clearly echoed in Governor’s statement; moreover, his statement reiterated the focus to achieve the inflation target of 4 percent. The resolve by the RBI to do “whatever is necessary” to bring inflation down on a sustained basis to the median target is likely to push forward rate cut expectations to perhaps in February 2024 but that would be data dependent. The policy statement was a non-event from the equity markets perspective.

Brokerage firm Macquarie Research has downgraded HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life Insurance to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and lowered their target prices, based on a weaker growth outlook for the insurance industry.

Macquarie Research has cut the target price for HDFC Life Insurance to Rs 556 from Rs 655 earlier, ICICI Prudential Life target price to Rs 486 from Rs 580 and SBI Life Insurance target price to Rs 1,306 from Rs1,580 a share.

Macquarie says insurance companies and the overall sector lack near-term catalysts and, unless there is a significant and meaningful increase in growth, the performance of insurance companies is expected to lag.

178	IBULHSGFIN	Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.

The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.

""Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.

""The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,"" Shetti said.

The broader markets continued the uptrend for more than a couple of weeks now, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index up 0.14 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.36 percent.

""The Bank Nifty index is expected to continue to trade within the range of 43,700-44,300. This suggests that the index is likely to move sideways, lacking a clear trend,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

The stock has been in the news after global research and broking firm JP Morgan downgraded it to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"" and cut its target price by over 16 percent to Rs 1,580. The revised price target implies a potential downside of around 21 percent from the closing price on June 8.

JP Morgan's report cited increasing uncertainty surrounding the company's future profitability following the Securities and Exchange Board of India's draft paper on expense ratios and fee structure in the asset management industry as reasons for the downgrade.

The market regulator aims to streamline the structure at the AMC level by incorporating several charges within the total expense ratio rather than at the scheme level.

The JP Morgan report said the exact impact of these proposed changes remains unclear, however, it could potentially result in a 10-15 percent reduction in earnings.

The tone of the discussion paper indicates that obtaining concessions may be challenging. This regulatory uncertainty raises concerns about the company's profitability outlook and its ability to maintain its current long-cycle margin structure of 35 basis points, JP Morgan said.

186	HONAUT	Honeywell Automation India Ltd	Honeywell developing avionics in India for global firms: Kalyandurg	"June 08, 2023 07:42 pm | Updated 07:42 pm IST - Bengaluru

North Carolina-based Honeywell is designing, developing and testing an array of avionics hardware and software systems, packages, platforms and solutions for various small, narrow and wide-body airplanes at multiple aerospace labs it has in Bengaluru.

Honeywell is currently building a high-end flight management system (FMS) and other packages for Boeing 777X, claimed to be the world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet scheduled for commercial introduction globally in 2025.

Typically, an FMS is a specialised computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks. It displays a flight plan informing pilots about the number of passengers on board, destination, flying distance, the amount of fuel the plane carries, take off, landing and cruising speed to ensure a safe and fuel-efficient flight.

The firm is also designing similar systems and critical in-flight communication infrastructure for Airbus (Airbus A320, A350, A380, etc) at its various labs in India.

For E1 and E2, medium-range twinjet airliners designed and produced by the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer, Honeywell is designing and building end-to-end avionics systems on its Epic Cockpit platform, Primus Epic 2.0. The platform enhances interactive navigation and increases an airplane’s performance and safety by identifying difficult terrain and efficiently redirecting flight paths, as per Honeywell.

Similar avionics projects are underway for business jets produced by U.S-based Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and French aerospace firm Dassault Aviation.

Niranjan Kalyandurg, Vice President, Engineering & Aerospace Leader, Honeywell Technology Solutions Ltd told The Hindu, “More such global projects, to help airplanes communicate, aviate and navigate better, are coming to Honeywell. In some cases, depending on the expertise, our labs in India will handle a major chunk of the work, while in some projects, we collaborate between our labs in India, the Czech Republic, Europe and the U.S.”

Aerospace was a key vertical for Honeywell and of the total $34.5 billion revenue the company posted globally in calendar 2022, aerospace accounted for $11.9 billion of which avionics alone brought it revenue worth $4.5 billion, Mr. Kalyandurg added.

Honeywell invested $130 million in establishing over 10 aero labs across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Madurai in the last 29 years. The company’s aerospace division employs 2,100 aero engineers while Honeywell employs more than 13,000 people, across verticals, in India."

The outdoor facility is around 40,000 sq. feet (70 per cent of a football field), and the space is covered with a net at 80 feet height, said Niranjan Kalyandurg, Vice-President, Aero India Leader, Honeywell Technology Solutions.

The lab, which will be a part of Honeywell Madurai, will have an indoor and outdoor facility; and is expected to be launched in August or September.

Elaborating on setting up the facility, he said the key objectives of the facility include verifying and validating the algorithms, technologies, and solutions developed by Honeywell, enabling the eco-system, in particular, the students from universities, to use the facility and gain practical knowledge on UAS and advanced air mobility systems, and demonstrating different technologies and products on UAS and advanced air mobility to regional customers in India.

From a drone point of view, the company is keen on forming multiple strategic partnerships with local drone manufacturers, such as those for navigation equipment. “We are also working on drone technologies such as anti-jamming (GPS jamming)—basically, jammers confuse drones, and we are trying to work on a solution for the same.”

“In the case of drones, we see a great market opportunity across various activities. Today, drones can be anyone across various sectors, and we see a great market opportunity in the short term in the country,” he added.

Urban air mobility

In addition to drones, urban air mobility (UAM) is another area of interest for the company. However, the company feels that in India, it is still too soon to decide where and to what extent the market opportunities are available in the segment, “but this is one of the key areas of interest for the company in the future,” he noted. In regards to urban air mobility on a global level, it is working with 5–6 companies, such as Lilium.

187	ICICIBANK	ICICI Bank Ltd	Large corporates should not get banking licences in India, says veteran banker Narayanan Vaghul	"Veteran banker Narayanan Vaghul, while speaking to Business Today, said that industrial houses should not get banking licences and the Indian banking system must be run by professionals. He was responding to a question on whether the Reserve Bank of India should hand out more banking licences.

Vaghul also spoke at length about the PSU banks versus private banks debate, the Indian banking system, and much more.

While speaking about the manner in which PSU banks are handled, he said, “In my tenure, I didn’t like the way the government controls PSU banks. The market values private sector banks more than public sector banks.” The way the government manages the PSU banks is depressing.

On how PSU banks can improve operations, Vaghul said that the government should step out of the PSU banks in order to increase its efficiency. He further mentioned that RBI held shares of the State Bank of India for the longest time and therefore it is very important that the government should step out of the banking system to ensure seamless operations of banks.

While talking about the need for more banks, Vaghul said that the size of banking should reflect on the size of the economy. “Indian banking is far ahead in terms of technology and we have to prepare ourselves for banking in 2030.”

He also spoke about gender neutrality in the banking sector. “Gender neutrality is a must for any organisation and we should remove barriers for women.”

The 87-year-old, who formerly headed ICICI Bank, said going forward, the private sector banks' play in the financial sector will grow so fast that automatically the heft of public sector banks will keep moving down.

In April, Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman launched ‘Reflections’, a book authored by eminent banker Narayanan Vaghul, in Mumbai. The book carries a vivid account of Vaghul’s experiences spanning decades in India’s financial landscape.

Vodafone and CK Hutchison are in the final stages of agreeing to merge their British operations, with a long-awaited announcement expected as soon as Friday or early next week, three sources have told Reuters.

193	INDIACEM	India Cements Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"Trading

With the Nifty50 falling below the 18,600 mark on June 9, we saw selling pressure in equity benchmarks for yet another session as all sectors trended down, led by FMCG and IT.

The BSE Sensex dropped 223 points to 62,626, while the Nifty50 declined 71 points to 18,563, and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts for the second straight session.

Overall, the Nifty is not displaying any major signs of weakness. However, ""at higher levels, signs of exhaustion are emerging, with negative divergence observed in momentum indicators, suggesting a potential for profit booking in the market,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

He feels the immediate and crucial support level stands at the 20-day moving average (DMA) of 18,450, and if breached, the next support level would be 18,180. On the upside, the 18,800-18,888 range is seen to be a resistance zone, he said.

Broader markets also trended downward, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling over one-tenth of a percent each on weak breadth, even as volatility remained lower levels. The India VIX closed at a one-and-half-month low (11.12), indicating that the market is more stable.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

According to the pivot point calculator, the Nifty may find support at 18,552, followed by 18,523 and 18,477. If the index advances, then 18,645 will be the key resistance, followed by 18,673 and 18,720.

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels in the later part of the session and ended the day 6.3 points down at 43,989, forming a small-bodied bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily scale.

""We expect the prices to oscillate within a broad horizontal range of 43,500-44,500. Currently, the index is trading above the 21-day EMA (exponential moving average), which aligns near 43,850. A significant breach below this EMA level would strengthen the possibility of further decline towards 43,500,"" said Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President at Master Capital Services.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to find support at 43,937, followed by 43,870 and 43,760, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,157, then 44,225 and 44,335.

195	ICICIGI	ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd	PMFBY back in favour as insurers return to do business	"With several steps taken in the last few months infusing technology and reducing crop insurance business risk, ICICI Lombard, Tata AIG, Cholamandalam, and Oriental Insurance have returned this year. All these four insurance companies had quit crop insurance business four years back, citing unviable claims amount.

Besides, a new entrant Kshema General Insurance has also been empanelled and is bidding for Kharif 2023 in Madhya Pradesh, said a senior official in agriculture ministry.

In 2019-20 (both kharif and rabi seasons), these private insurance companies had opted out of the flagship PM Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme due to high claims ratios in the States where they operated in the previous year, leading to losses from the business. However, they continued with the empanelment in last four years.

Shriram General Insurance, another private insurer who had withdrawn from the crop insurance segment from 2019-20 and Royal Sundaram, who has not been participating in bids from 2020, have not shown interest in this year’s bidding, official sources said.

Crop damages in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh in 2018-19 had pushed farmers’ claims against the premium collected by the insurance companies to over 100 per cent, whereas the claim ratio was 75.4 on all India basis.

Oriental Insurance, who quit last year, has also returned in 2023 with its participation in the bidding process in Maharashtra, the sources said. Both Tata AIG and ICICI Lombard have participated in bids in Maharashtra, too. Cholamandalam is said to have bid in Uttarakhand and Karnataka, the sources added.

Under PMFBY, launched in 2016, farmers pay a fixed 1.5 per cent of the sum insured for rabi crops and 2 per cent for kharif while it is 5 per cent for cash crops. The actual premium is derived through a process of bids from insurers every year and any amount above what farmers pay is subsidised by the government, which is shared between the Centre and States on a 50:50 basis. Lesser participation of insurers leads to higher premiums and also increased subsidy burden for the government, the official said.

In FY23, out of ₹28,666 crore gross premium collected by insurance companies under PMFBY, the farmers’ share was only ₹3,891 crore (or 13.6 per cent).

“Though the government has capped premiums at 25 per cent and 30 per cent based on irrigation facilities in the cultivated land, still they are high compared to what farmers pay as their share. Only the technology infusion can bring in transparency and reduce risk, which we are adopting in a big way,” the senior official said.

The government is scheduled to unveil a host of steps this week to make PMFBY tech-savvy and those include a collection of data-yield, rainfall, temperature, and humidity – from farmers’ fields, sources said."

Brokerage firm Macquarie Research has downgraded HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life Insurance to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and lowered their target prices, based on a weaker growth outlook for the insurance industry.

Macquarie Research has cut the target price for HDFC Life Insurance to Rs 556 from Rs 655 earlier, ICICI Prudential Life target price to Rs 486 from Rs 580 and SBI Life Insurance target price to Rs 1,306 from Rs1,580 a share.

Macquarie says insurance companies and the overall sector lack near-term catalysts and, unless there is a significant and meaningful increase in growth, the performance of insurance companies is expected to lag.

Insurance stocks came under pressure after the government in the budget proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. The Centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards.

198	ICICIPRULI	ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd	ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund rose 7x in 15 years: Can it remain an outlier in the large-cap category?	"Launched in 2008, the annus horribilis for global markets courtesy the global financial crisis, ICICI Pru Bluechip Fund literally had a trial by fire. Over the last 15 years, the large-cap fund has emerged the biggest actively-managed scheme in its category courtesy a decent performance.

Having multiplied your money seven-fold since inception, the key question today is, will the marquee fund be able to withstand the onslaught of passive rivals (index funds and ETFs) --- the proverbial barbarians at the gate?

Truth be told, a significant number of actively-managed large-cap funds have found the going very tough in recent years as they have failed to match up against benchmarks, especially after SEBI categorisation norms and use of the total return index variants for benchmarking.

Fund basics

Launched on May 23, 2008, ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund is an open-ended equity scheme that predominantly invests in large-cap stocks. It aims to maintain a minimum exposure of 80 per cent towards equity and equity related instruments of large-cap companies. The large-cap category is generally less volatile than most other equity scheme categories.

The large-cap equity scheme has been positioned as one that focusses on stocks in which the fund manager has high conviction. All actively-managed large-cap funds have the same universe i.e. top 100 stocks by market capitalisation. Funds that pick better stocks and assign proper weights do better than others.

The scheme adopts a benchmark sector-neutral approach to keep the portfolio well diversified across sectors.

The fund maintains a portfolio with a predominantly “buy and hold” approach. It is known to take aggressive positions in high-conviction stocks with the aim to generate alpha.

Stock selection is based on a bottom-up approach. This has largely remained unchanged over the last 15 years amid trade wars, taper tantrums, geopolitical tensions and interest rate cycles.

As compared to the benchmark, currently, the portfolio is overweight in auto, industrial products, capital goods and telecom

Historical returns

ICICI Pru Bluechip was launched on May 23, 2008. As on May 31, 2023, the scheme has outperformed the Nifty 100 TRI and the actively-managed large-cap fund category across all timeframes i.e. – since inception, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years (see table)."

200	INDHOTEL	Indian Hotels Company Ltd	Who Is The Younger Brother Of Ratan Tata Who Resides In A 2 BHK Flat, Doesn’t Even Own A Cell Phone	"Jimmy Tata is Ratan Tata's younger brother and the son of Naval Tata, the former chairman of Tata Sons. He would rather avoid publicity and the media. Business tycoon Ratan Tata never married. But he remained very close to his siblings, especially his younger brother Jimmy Naval Tata. In order to wish his brother Jimmy a happy birthday, Ratan Tata shared a black-and-white photo of himself with him and their dog a few months ago. In his words, ""nothing came between"" the two brothers. As a result, internet users became more curious and began learning more about Jimmy Naval Tata.

Billionaire Ratan Tata, one of India's most popular and favorite businessmen, has more than 7 million Instagram followers. He has established a solid reputation as a people person because of his modest outlook on both life and business. Ratan Tata claims that the photograph was taken in 1945. Tata posted this image to Instagram and commented that their childhood was blissful because nothing could separate the two brothers. At the time this story was being written, Tata's most recent Instagram post had received more than 10 Lakh likes in two hours since it was posted. Users praised Tata for having such a remarkable recollection after the look into his history appeared on his Instagram.

Former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata is a proponent of leading a simple life. Jimmy Naval Tata was successful running the family business, but he made the decision to slow down and live a simple life. Jimmy Tata, despite his enormous riches, resides in a two-bedroom flat in Mumbai's Colaba area. He reportedly doesn't even have a phone, yet he still reads books and newspapers. Billionaire and philanthropist Harsh Goenka last year made a post in which he referenced Jimmy Tata's modest flat and lack of involvement in the family business. Not only that, but he also claimed Jimmy Tata, a superb squash player, used to consistently defeat him (Harsh Goenka).

However, Jimmy Tata is still a significant shareholder in Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Sons, TCS, Tata Power, Indian Hotels, and Tata Chemicals, for those who are unaware.

But he remained very close to his siblings, especially his younger brother Jimmy Naval Tata.
As a result, internet users became more curious and began learning more about Jimmy Naval Tata.

206	IRCTC	Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd	IRCTC’s 35 Paise Travel Insurance: Claiming up to Rs 10 lakh made easy	"The recent tragic train accident in Odisha’s Balasore district has left a profound impact, with a loss of 288 lives and injuries to 1,091 individuals. Relief and rescue operations have been carried out, and efforts are underway to restore the train services by repairing the tracks. In light of this tragedy, the government has announced ex-gratia compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the relatives of the deceased, Rs 2 lakh for the injured, and Rs 50,000 for those with minor injuries. It is worth noting that when booking train tickets through IRCTC, travellers are offered an additional option—travel insurance.

This incident emphasises the significance of insurance coverage in such unfortunate events. By paying just 35 paise, passengers can avail themselves of a cover of Rs 10 lakh. However, it’s important to note that this travel insurance is not provided directly by the Railways but by insurance companies. It is an optional feature available during online ticket booking, allowing passengers to opt for insurance if desired.

To avail travel insurance when travelling by train, passengers need to select the option at the time of ticket purchase through IRCTC’s online platform. By paying a nominal fee of 35 paise, travellers can obtain a cover of Rs 10 lakh. Once the insurance is opted for, a confirmation email containing relevant details and instructions is sent to the registered email address. Passengers must open the document and fill in the required information, including full name and date of birth, for the insurance to be valid.

Partial disability warrants a compensation of Rs 7.5 lakh and minor injuries are compensated with Rs 10,000. To make a claim, individuals must visit the nearest office of the insurance company within four months from the date of the train accident. They need to submit the necessary documents as per the requirements of the insurance company. It’s important to note that this travel insurance facility is applicable only for confirmed or RAC (Reservation Against Cancellation) tickets.

When you book a train ticket from IRCTC, there is an option to pay Rs. 0.35 for Insurance. Many people opt for that insurance and get a form in their mail to fill in their basic details and nominee details but mostly, no one does that. Did you know that this insurance gives you… — Sambhav Daga (@sambhavdaga) June 5, 2023

Sambhav Daga, a well-known Chartered Accountant and member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), recently brought attention to the Travel Insurance offered by IRCTC through a post on Twitter. Daga emphasised that when booking train tickets via IRCTC, passengers have the opportunity to avail insurance coverage by paying a nominal amount of 35 paise. He also highlighted an important aspect that often goes unnoticed—many individuals fail to fill out the accompanying form, which asks for basic information and nominee details.

The availability of such travel insurance coverage serves as a crucial measure to provide financial support and assistance to passengers during unforeseen circumstances while travelling by train.

206	IRCTC	Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd	Odisha Train Tragedy: Only Small Number Of Passengers Opted For Rs 10 Lakhs Insurance Cover	"Chennai: With only a small number of passengers of two ill-fated trains involved in the June 2 Odisha tragedy seems to have opted for the Rs 10 lakhs insurance cover by paying just Re.035 paise and now it is time for the Centre to bundle the cover with all the tickets booked through the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd's (IRCTC) online portal, said insurance professionals.

As per the initial indications, only a small number of passengers of the two passenger trains have opted for the travel accident insurance cover while booking through the IRCTC portal.

Replying to a list of questions sent to SBI General Insurance's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kishore Kumar Poludasu, a company spokesperson told IANS: ""As per data available, SBI General has covered 351 passengers.""

According to the SBI General Insurance official, a few claims for injury have been lodged with the company by the passengers of the two trains.

On the other hand, Roopam Asthana, Wholetime Director and CEO of Liberty General Insurance did not respond to the questions sent to him by IANS.

In that tragic accident, 288 passengers were killed and more than 1,000 others injured.

The IRCTC has selected SBI General Insurance and Liberty General Insurance to offer the travel accident insurance cover.

Those who reserveed tickets through IRCTC booking portal can opt for accident insurance for Rs 10 lakhs by paying a paltry premium of Re 0.35 paise.

The policy covers death/disabilities/medical expenses due to a train accident during the travel.

Both the companies declined to answer as to how the number of policies are divided between the two insurers when the tickets are booked.

Similarly the top officials of the two companies remained silent when queried about covering all the passengers which in turn would bring down the premium amount.

An industry official said the two insurers get an equal number of policies while the passengers book their tickets through the IRCTC portal. However, the number of passengers covered under a policy/ticket would differ.

""Even though they would like to have an insurance cover, not many passengers while booking a Tatkal train ticket on the IRCTC portal will be inclined to click on the insurance cover box as their main goal to reserve a ticket as every second counts during that time,"" the insurance official said.

Further if all the train passengers are offered the travel insurance cover then the premium amount will further come down from 35 paise.

According to IRCTC's regulatory filing of investor call transcript, during the last quarter of FY23, a total number of 10.44 crore tickets have been booked and 14.54 crores passengers have been booked on these tickets.

For the entire FY23, IRCTC had earned Rs.802 crore revenue from the internet ticketing service.

A total of 43 crore tickets were booked on IRCTC portal, the company said.

And in the last quarter of FY23, the convenience fee that IRCTC had earned was nearly Rs197 crore.

When the insurance scheme was started in 2016, the premium was 0.92 paise per passenger with Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd, and Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co. Ltd being the insurers."

208	ISEC	ICICI Securities Ltd	Infosys shares have up to 28% upside potential; most attractive risk-reward in IT space, say analysts	"The June quarter results of IT major Infosys are likely to be weak, but that is largely known to the Street. Analysts tracking the stock said headwinds for Infosys are largely priced in and that the stock has most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys is trading at a valuation of 19.6 times one-year forward earnings per share, closer to its last 15-year average multiple of 19 times. ICICI Securities said soft revenue growth in FY24 is already factored in the current stock price, and announcement of mega deal wins will potentially help the stock re-rate from these levels.

""Infosys has already announced 4-5 deal wins in the current quarter (Q1FY24) and has good mega deal pipeline with some deals in advanced stages. We believe risk-reward ratio is favourable with limited downside (8-9 per cent) for Infosys from current levels in a bear case scenario of 8-9 per cent YoY CC revenue growth in FY25E and FY26E,"" it said in its analysis of Infosys annual report.

Shares of Infosys rose 1.64 per cent to a high of Rs 1,286.70 on BSE. ICICI Securities continued to value Infosys at 23 times on FY26 EPS of Rs 80 to arrive at an unchanged target price of Rs 1,641, implying 28 per cent potential upside. The domestic brokerage said Infosys has the most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys' discretionary business has been adversely impacted by the macroeconomic slowdown over the last few months and that the delayed decision-making and higher deal scrutiny will have a direct impact on the deal conversion, said Motilal Oswal Securities. This brokerage sees FY24 revenue growth for Infosys at 5.2 per cent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms, which falls under the lower end of the guidance range.

The average price target on Infosys stock at Rs 1,500 suggests a 17 per cent potential upside.

Meanwhile, JM Financial said the probability of Infosys reporting another quarter of sequential decline is not insignificant. Infosys’ March quarter miss was attributable largely to project cancellations in March alone.

""Two months of incremental impact means Infosys’ starting point for 1QFY24 is a revenue deficit of $180mn. Even adjusting for seasonal strengths – higher working days, new project starts, Infosys may not be able to recoup this deficit entirely. We are therefore building a 1 per cent QoQ decline. Most revenue guidance available currently for 1QFY24 - Wipro, Cognizant, EPAM, DAVA - are pointing to a sequential decline anyways,"" said JM Financial.

""A weak start also means CQGR needed in 2H to achieve 4-7 per cent cc revenue growth guidance will rise to 5-9 per cent. Infosys will need a few mega deals to achieve even the lower end of its guidance range, in our view. We assume a healthy pick-up in an otherwise seasonally weak 2H (4 per cent CQGR) as we build impact of mega deals (not won yet),"" it said.

ICICI Securities has rated Sansera Engineering Ltd stock as buy with a retain target price of Rs 280.

Sansera Engineering (SEL) aims to achieve Rs 3,500 crore in revenue by FY25, driven by the revival of domestic two-wheeler demand, growth in export markets and expansion in the aerospace segment.

According to the brokerage, SEL expects a Rs 1,200 crore growth in revenue for FY25 as against Rs 2,300 crore revenue for FY23. ICICI Securities reported, “Sansera Engineering (SEL) aims to double revenue from its Bidadi plant, reaching nearly Rs 500 crore by FY25 with the addition of a new 4000T press”.

The Bidadi facility, serving OEMs like Royal Enfield and KTM, targets an increase in aluminium forging revenue from Rs 60 crore in FY23 to Rs 150 crore by FY25. SEL plans to diversify its forging business, particularly in the Electric Vehicle (EV) segment.

With the establishment of a new aerospace facility, SEL expects a Rs 350 crore revenue, according to the brokerage’s report. By shifting machinery from the older plant, the company aims to raise aerospace revenue from Rs 90 crore in FY23 to Rs 250 crore by FY25.

ICICI Securities reported that expanding exports is a key focus for SEL, with a growth target of approximately 40-50 percent in FY23. This growth will be driven by the aluminium forging and aerospace businesses, along with strategic partnerships with companies like Polaris ATV, Tesla and CNH.

SEL plans to increase its EBITDA margin from 16 percent in FY23 to 18-19 percent in FY25, leveraging a favourable mix of exports and aerospace revenue. The company aims to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 0.55x to 0.4x by FY25, as reported by ICICI Securities.

By operating with an 8-9 percent capex-to-sales ratio and optimizing assets, SEL aims to achieve a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of nearly 20 percent, improving overall profitability.

During the March quarter, Sansera Engineering Ltd reported net sales of Rs 2,338.3 crore for FY22, up 17.5 percent from Rs 1,989 crore in FY22. Net profit rose 7.7 percent from Rs 130.5 crore in FY22 to Rs 146.2 crore in FY23. The company's FY23 EBITDA stood at Rs 246.9 crore, up 15.4 percent, compared to Rs 213.9 crore in FY22. The EPS for the SEL share is 28.5 for FY23 as against 25.4 for FY22.

The SEL share is currently trading at Rs 849.70 at 11:45 am on June 12."	"Sansera Engineering (India) Ltd. Representative Imagelive bse livense live Volume Todays L/H More ×ICICI Securities has rated Sansera Engineering Ltd stock as buy with a retain target price of Rs 280.

209	ITC	ITC Ltd	No big downside or upside from current levels expected in ITC: Sandip Sabharwal	"""I think there are two aspects to it: one is the overall industry scenario where competitive intensity increased. The second is the fact that we have had a series of summers where something or the other has come up,"" says Sandip Sabharwal , asksandipsabharwal.com.I think there are two aspects to it: one is the overall industry scenario where competitive intensity increased. The second is the fact that we have had a series of summers where something or the other has come up. First was the delta wave, secondly, late winters last year. This year also, north hardly saw late summers, saw any summers. I think that is leading to the subdued performance. So there are two aspects to Voltas performance; one is the unitary cooling products where obviously things are subdued. Second is the projects business where they have seen significant upside traction.So I would be actually looking at buying this stock at some stage because this fall in the prices is actually something which I like. So let us see if it falls a bit further, comes another 10% down, then I would actually be a buyer rather than try to ignore the stock.Very tough to decipher these changes because actually I have not bought into this stock ever because I always thought that it is very cyclical because in periods of shortages, always summers is when they do well, then as the shortages go away, trading activity is subdued. So it was very tough to buy it fundamentally. So that is why I have no idea.Yes, so what has happened over the last two years is that valuations have moved up substantially. ITC used to pay Rs 10 dividend, it was a Rs 200 price, so just the dividend yield was so high. There was extreme negativity, like you said. Now, the stock is up 65% over the last one year. At a time when other FMCG companies have virtually gone nowhere or some are in fact down, except for something like Britannia , etc, which has specific things going for it. Now, at the current valuations, I would think that it is a neutral kind of stock. There is no major reason for anyone who is holding to sell it.But I think for it to outperform from current levels, there are more triggers required and which we need to see, more improvement in FMCG profitability, what they are going to do with the hotels business expansion, etc.So, I think these are some things we need to monitor. So, I would think that no big downside or upside from current levels.It is tough to say given the fact that it is already up, it is not Rs 200 or Rs 300 stock now, it is almost Rs 600 stock now. The ECL provision management might not be worried about, but it could have an impact. So, the management talks about funding new-age businesses, etc. So, we have typically seen historically banks which are very aggressive in funding these newer age businesses typically end up having NPA issues going forward.I think there are various things we need to monitor. If I would still be more inclined towards larger private sector banks or upcoming private sector banks, ICICI, Axis, IDFC , I think these would more be on my outperformer list."

209	ITC	ITC Ltd	F&O Strategy: ITC Stock Faces Short-Term Resistance, Long-Term Outlook Positive	"The stock of ITC (₹438.45), in the short term, may find some resistance, although the long-term outlook remains positive. The immediate support is at ₹420 and the major one at ₹375. A close below the latter will cancel the bullish outlook, potentially leading to a fall to ₹344. However, if the stock manages to sustain the current rally, the stock could make new highs above ₹500.

However, we expect ITC to move in a narrow range with downward bias in the short term.

F&O pointers: The ITC June futures on Friday closed at ₹440.85, at a premium against the spot price of ₹438.45. This signals the existence of long positions, as traders still remain bullish on the stock and are willing to carry their buys. Option trading indicates that the stock may move between ₹420 and ₹475, where respective put and call options witnessed concentration of open interests.

Strategy: We advise traders to consider plain-vanilla option strategy on ITC. Traders can buy the 435-strike put option, which closed at ₹4.25. As the market lot is 1,600 shares, this strategy will cost ₹6,800, which will be the maximum loss. This will happen if ITC fails to fall below ₹435 before expiry.

However, profit potential is huge should the stock slide sharply within the next few days. The break-even point is ₹430.75.

We advise traders to hold the position and can aim for an initial target ₹10 (premium value) and a final target of ₹15. Keep the stop-loss according to the individual risk profile. Hold the position for at least two weeks.

Follow-up:TVS Motor moved on expected lines, and we advise traders to book profits

213	INFY	Infosys Ltd	Infosys shares have up to 28% upside potential; most attractive risk-reward in IT space, say analysts	"The June quarter results of IT major Infosys are likely to be weak, but that is largely known to the Street. Analysts tracking the stock said headwinds for Infosys are largely priced in and that the stock has most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys is trading at a valuation of 19.6 times one-year forward earnings per share, closer to its last 15-year average multiple of 19 times. ICICI Securities said soft revenue growth in FY24 is already factored in the current stock price, and announcement of mega deal wins will potentially help the stock re-rate from these levels.

""Infosys has already announced 4-5 deal wins in the current quarter (Q1FY24) and has good mega deal pipeline with some deals in advanced stages. We believe risk-reward ratio is favourable with limited downside (8-9 per cent) for Infosys from current levels in a bear case scenario of 8-9 per cent YoY CC revenue growth in FY25E and FY26E,"" it said in its analysis of Infosys annual report.

Shares of Infosys rose 1.64 per cent to a high of Rs 1,286.70 on BSE. ICICI Securities continued to value Infosys at 23 times on FY26 EPS of Rs 80 to arrive at an unchanged target price of Rs 1,641, implying 28 per cent potential upside. The domestic brokerage said Infosys has the most attractive risk-reward in the IT space.

Infosys' discretionary business has been adversely impacted by the macroeconomic slowdown over the last few months and that the delayed decision-making and higher deal scrutiny will have a direct impact on the deal conversion, said Motilal Oswal Securities. This brokerage sees FY24 revenue growth for Infosys at 5.2 per cent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms, which falls under the lower end of the guidance range.

""Despite near-term weakness, we expect Infosys to be a key beneficiary of acceleration in IT spends in the medium/long term. The stock is currently trading at 18 times FY25E EPS. We value the stock at 21 times FY25E EPS, implying a target price of Rs 1,520,"" it said.

On the weekly chart, the banking index has formed a bearish candle along with an Inside candle. The RSI momentum indicator is currently trading around 62 level.

A breakout above the all-time high level of 44,498.60 on Nifty Bank may further push the index towards the 45,000 level.

A strong support is located at 43,400-43,550 levels; if the Index closes below the mentioned support, the momentum will shift to downside. It is recommended that traders and investors should buy the dips in Nifty Bank with proper stio loss below the supports mentioned.

217	IOC	Indian Oil Corporation Ltd	IndianOil top bidder for Reliance’s KG gas for second auction in row	"Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation's largest oil firm, has walked away with half of the natural gas that Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp of the UK offered in the latest auction of the fuel used to generate power, produce fertilizer, turned into CNG and used for cooking purposes.

IOC got 2.5 million standard cubic meters per day out of the 5 mmscmd of gas auctioned last month, sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The oil refining and marketing company, which was the top bidder even in the previous auction of gas from the eastern offshore KG-D6 block of Reliance-bp, bid the volumes on behalf of seven fertilizer plants.

City gas companies including GAIL Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd, Torrent Gas, Indian Oil Adani Gas Ltd, and Haryana City Gas secured a total of 0.5 mmscmd of gas for turning into CNG for sale to automobiles and piped to household kitchens for cooking purposes.

State gas utility GAIL and refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) got 0.6 mmscmd each while Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) walked away with 0.5 mmscmd and Shell another 0.2 mmscmd, they said.

Reliance-bp, which two years back reversed the declining trend in domestic gas output by bringing to production their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block lying in deepsea of the Bay of Bengal, are now ramping up supplies.

Natural gas, a cleaner-burning, efficient fuel, is being seen as a transition fuel for nations to move from polluting hydrocarbons to zero-emission fuels.

Reliance-bp in the latest tender offered 5 mmscmd of gas for a period of 3 years starting June 1. Bidders were asked to quote a variable 'v' over and above the JKM price, the spot market benchmark for liquefied natural gas (LNG) delivered to Japan and South Korea.

Sources said the e-auction started on May 19 and ended on May 23 - the longest duration of an auction since the time operators were allowed to sell fuel through open tender.

At the end of the e-auction, gas was sold to 16 buyers at a price of JKM + (plus) USD 0.75 per mmBtu for 3 years, they said adding at the current JKM price of USD 9.2 per mmBtu, the price for KG-D6 gas comes to around USD 10.

This rate compares with the capped price of USD 6.5 per mmBtu that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the state-owned behemoth, gas for fuel produced from legacy or old fields.

Reliance-bp had in April sold 6 mmscmd of gas. IOC had walked away with almost half of the 6 mmscmd of gas sold in an e-auction on April 12 while GAIL bought 0.7 mmscmd, Adani-Total Gas Ltd 0.4 mmscmd, Shell 0.5 mmscmd, GSPC 0.25 mmscmd and IGS another 0.5 mmscmd.

In that auction too, the final bid price came at USD 0.75 per mmBtu premium over the JKM price (JKM + USD 0.75 per mmBtu), sources said.

But the bidders will only have to pay the ceiling or the cap price that the government fixes bi-annually for gas produced from difficult areas, such as deepsea and high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP).

The ceiling price for April to September is USD 12.12 per mmBtu.

Gas produced from wells drilled below the seabed is used to produce electricity, make fertiliser, or turned into CNG for powering automobiles or piped to household kitchens for cooking as well as in industries.

In May last year, Reliance-bp had auctioned 5.5 mmscmd of incremental gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to the same JKM gas marker.

The price discovered in that e-auction came at a USD 0.06 discount to the JKM (Japan-Korea Marker) LNG price.

Prior to that, the duo had sold 7.5 mmscmd of gas at a discount of USD 0.18 per mmBtu to JKM.

Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production in April 2009, and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put into production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing in September 2018, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020.

Since then, Reliance-bp is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ -- which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023."

222	JKCEMENT	J K Cement Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The market has seen a correction for the first time in the last five consecutive sessions on June 8, after the RBI Monetary Policy Committee unanimously held the repo rate at 6.5 percent, in line with consensus expectations while retaining the withdrawal of accommodation stance by five out of six votes. Most of the sectors, barring metal, saw correction.

The BSE Sensex fell 294 points to 62,849, while the Nifty50 declined 92 points to 18,635 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, which experts feel is the short-term reversal of the trend.

""A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with an upper shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates rejection of bulls at the highs and this could be considered as a short-term reversal pattern on the downside,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He feels Thursday's swing high could be considered as a new higher top of the sequence and further weakness for the short term is expected to be a higher bottom of the sequence.

At the lows, Nifty could find cluster support like ascending trendline, 10-day and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) around 18,560-18,450 levels, he said.

The broader markets also snapped rallies of several sessions as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 0.55 percent and 0.95 percent, respectively.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

The Nifty may get support at 18,614 followed by 18,576 and 18,514. If the index advances, then 18,738 will be the key resistance followed by 18,776 and 18,838.

A breach below this support level might indicate a further downside potential and could attract additional selling interest from traders and investors,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

The index is stuck in a range and a break on either side will have a directional move, he feels.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 43,917, followed by 43,790 and 43,583, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,331, then 44,459 and 44,665.

223	JSWSTEEL	JSW Steel Ltd	JSW Steel to scout for domestic mines despite rise in litigations	"Notwithstanding the rising instances of litigation, JSW Steel has decided to scout for domestic iron ore and coking coal mines to shore up captive sourcing of key raw materials.

The company has recently received show-cause notices from Deputy Director of Mines, Joda-Koira, for alleged loss of royalty, mining premium and other levies of ₹702 crore.

The notices pertain to drop in grade of iron ore mined in the last two years compared with mining plan. The company had earlier claimed that the mining plans are made for 10-15 years and it cannot be validated every two years.

The company has contested the show-cause notice with Revisionary Authority, Ministry of Mines. The Authority has directed the State Government not to take any coercive measures in relation to demand notices until the State government responds to the company’s observations.

GST anomaly

Last September, JSW Steel moved the Appellate authority within the GST department of Odisha against the demand notice of ₹3,004 crore towards tax, penalty and interest on JSW Steel’s subsidiary which operates mines at Nuagoan, Jajang, Koira and Ganua.

The case was due to the anomaly in GST rate whereby the tax on input was higher that of the output goods. The iron ore mining subsidiary company paid 18 per cent GST on premium on mining and when iron ore was sold to the parent companies the GST rate was five per cent. This anomaly was subsequently, corrected by equalising both the GST rates.

However, the First Appellate Authority had confirmed the order passed by the GST Authorities. Aggrieved by appellant order, the company has submitted a Letter of Intent to file an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal.

Jayant Acharya, Joint Managing Director, JSW Steel, said the increase in number litigations involving mines is a cause of concern as it is not good for business and the company expects these issues be resolved.

In the case of Jajang mines, he said the company has got a favourable verdict in revision of MPPA (Mining Plan Preparing Agency) from 9.8 to 7.8 million tonnes which the company was requesting because certain things were included inadvertently, he said.

“We will continue to explore mining opportunities in India even while tackling the issues that crop up as captive sourcing is more cost-effective in the long run and provides certainty,” he added."

227	JSWENERGY	JSW Energy Ltd	Adani Transmission, Tata Power, JSW Energy, NTPC, Power Grid: Share price targets by Jefferies	"Jefferies in a latest note said Power Grid and NTPC with access to lowest-cost funding within the utility sector and government return-focussed boards, are best placed within the utility sector. JSW Energy has proved itself to be a return-conscious company, it said while suggesting 'Buy' ratings on the three stocks.

Jefferies also has buy rating on Adani Transmission but underperform rating on Tata Power and IEX.

Jefferies said the commentary by NTPC and Power Grid suggested no adverse outcome likely due to regulated ROE review in December and that will be more of a non-event, as 10-year G-sec yields are close to the levels when the last review took place in December 2018.

For NTPC, it has revised its target to Rs 205 from Rs 195 earlier. For Power Grid, it raised price target to Rs 275 from Rs 260 earlier.

Additionally, it noted, Ministry wants to encourage investment in generation and T&D particularly on the renewable side. ""Hence, we do not anticipate a material change beyond 50 bps, at most, on the 15.5 per cent regulated ROE. Final regulation should be out in January 2024 and normally mirrors the draft. Power Grid and NTPC are the most impacted by any change in this regulation, with Tata Power and Adani Transmission seeing a lower impact,"" it noted.

For Tata Power, Jefferies has a target of Rs 185 against Rs 175 earlier. It finds Adani Transmission worth Rs 1,400.

Watch: Adani Power, Adani Transmission and 2 other group stocks rise as BSE, NSE raise circuit limits

Jefferies said the game-changing distribution reform seems on the backburner for now. It noted that Electricity Distribution Act to promote privatisation is currently with the Parliamentary Standing Committee. Idea

is for State Electricity Boards (SEBs) to be pushed to eventually raise tariffs for the heavily subsidised agriculture sector and reduce losses, as private distribution companies can provide power at lower rates than the SEBs are providing to industrial consumers.

""We believe this has limited visibility for being passed for 18 months at least till National Elections are completed in May 2024, and cabinet/policy formulation will need time as well post the same. This has the highest impact for Adani Transmission, which was a play on these reforms, given which we have reduced terminal growth rate. Also factoring in higher interest rates and some under-recovery, our earnings estimates have also been impacted. A 1 percentage point reduction in the terminal growth rate would translate into a 10-15 per cent change in our price target. Others stocks are not materially impacted by this delay, and hence, we have not reduced their price targets,"" Jefferies said.

Jefferies noted that SECI awarded 12-15 GW annually in FY21-22, and FY23 ended at 6GW against a target of 15 GW. SEBs, it noted, are not giving demand requirements to SECI, as they are uncertain on the growth outlook post the next 24-36 months.

""Peak power demand deficits are being viewed as a temporary phenomenon for now, though they are being watched closely by SEBs. Awards are expected to pick up to 15 GW+ again if demand grows upward of 6-7 per cen,"" Jefferies said.

It has a target of Rs 325 on JSW Energy against Rs 315 earlier. On IEX, this foreign brokerage has an underperform rating with a target of Rs 120 from Rs 110 earlier.

Motilal Oswal's research report on JK Lakshmi Cement

JK Lakshmi Cement (JKLC) is among the least cost producers in the industry, backed by lower energy consumption, higher green power share (WHRS and Solar), and efficient management of the logistics. Given the early costcutting attempts, the company’s cost curve places it higher than its peers. Despite lower cost, JKLC’s profitability was significantly lower than peers’ average, mainly due to weak realizations. However, JKLC has made significant progress, led by the following: 1) increasing volume share in Gujarat market to 35% in FY23 from 29% in FY18; 2) The share of trade sale has also grown to 55%; 3) The company has achieved an increase in the share of premium products (stood at ~26% of trade sales in 4QFY23 v/s ~15% in FY20-end). As a result, EBITDA/t gap v/s peers’ average narrowed to INR163/t in FY23 from INR467/429 per tonne in FY17/FY18.

Outlook

We believe JKLC is trading at an attractive valuation of 6.5x FY25E EV/EBITDA and USD63/t (at a significant discount to the replacement cost). While we maintain our standalone estimates, we incorporate consolidated numbers in this note, given the expansion planned in its subsidiary. We value JKLC at 8.5x FY25E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our TP of INR870 and reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

233	JMFINANCIL	JM Financial Ltd	Reliance Industries shares at Rs 2,900? Debt concerns overdone, says JM Financial	"Reliance Industries' net debt may peak in FY24 and that concerns are it are largely overdone, says brokerage JM Financial as it suggests a target price of Rs 2,900 for the oil-to-telecom major. Shares of Reliance Industries have fallen 3 per cent year-to-date and 11 per cent in the past one year. This is against a 3 per cent rise for Sensex in 2023 and 14 per cent jump in the last one year.

Reliance Industries share price, JM Financial said, was very close to its worst-case value when it came out with its last update in March and that the key debates with investors since then have been on potential triggers that could actually drive a decisive rerating in the stock.

The key arguments against a re-rating were that there are limited earnings-upgrade triggers for now, low visibility on event-based triggers in the near term (listing of digital and retail businesses or strategic stake sale in clean energy or O2C businesses) and concerns over high capex and resultant rising net debt.

Besides, there are concerns of a likely delay in telecom tariff hike to mid-2024 (post the national elections) and uncertain macros globally, which could cap O2C margins.

Watch: Buzzing stocks on June 9, 2023: Paytm, Bank of Maharashtra, PTC Industries, IEX others

RIL's net debt in FY23 rose to Rs 1,10,200 crore or 0.8 times reported net debt-to-Ebitda. Adjusted net debt (including spectrum and other liabilities) had gone up to Rs 2,73,200 crore or 1.9 times adjusted net-debt to Ebitda.

This is due to the company’s aggressive capex, with FY23 capex soaring to Rs 2,29,900 crore (or Rs 1,41,800 crore excluding Rs 88,000 towards 5G spectrum).

""The concerns on debt are overdone, in our view. We expect RIL’s net debt to peak in FY24 and then decline gradually as capex will not only moderate (Rs 1.2-1.4 lakh crore per annum against Rs 2.3 lakh crore in FY23) but, importantly, also be fully funded by a gradual increase in internal cash generation,"" it said.

JM Financial said Reliance Industries guidance on keeping reported net debt to Ebitda below 1 times also gives it comfort.

""Be that as it may, we believe RIL could still drive a robust 14-15 per cent EPS CAGR over the next 3-5 years with Jio’s ARPU expected to rise at 10 per cent CAGR over FY23-28, and continued strong momentum in Retail including scale-up of new initiatives (FMCG foray, inorganic growth, etc.),"" it said.

Havells shares gained over 1.5 percent on June 7 after JM Financial analysts expressed optimism on the company’s plans to expand its manufacturing, and invest more in research and development.

JM Financial has a Buy rating on the stock with a target price Rs 1,420, indicating a 5 percent upside from current level.

With 90 percent of its products manufactured in-house, Havells aims to strengthen its presence across the entire value chain, said the analysts citing Havells' FY23 report added.

Firstly, the company plans to expand its footprint in the e-commerce segment, capitalising on the growing trend of online shopping. Secondly, it intends to deepen its penetration into the Indian market through the Rural Vistaar programme and Utsav stores. It has opened over 400 Utsav stores in FY23 and targets to increase it to 2,000 by FY24, stated the annual report.

Thirdly, the electrical equipment manufacturer is actively pursuing increased participation in business-to-business (B2B) projects and grow in international markets.

At 10:30 am, Havells was quoting at Rs 1,353.45 on the NSE, higher by 1.4 percent from previous close. The stock has been steadily gaining and is up 23 percent in 2023 so far.

Over the past five years, the company has allocated over Rs 550 crore towards R&D (research and development) initiatives and the trend will sustain going forward, said the annual report.

""Lloyd, along with channel expansion, strengthened its product portfolio during the year. We believes that Lloyd is now well positioned to leverage the AC performance to spur growth of other products, such as washing machines and refrigerators,"" the annual report added.

In FY23, Lloyd Consumer contributed 20 percent to the revenue mix, cables made for 32.8 percent, and switchgears were 12.6 percent.

Analysts' view

The broking firm expects some softness in near-term demand owing to unseasonal rains and weak summer intensity.

Data from Bloomberg shows that the stock has 24 Buy, 13 Hold, and 7 Sell calls on it. The stock is currently trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 79x, which warrants some caution, according to analysts.

Eleven non-F&O stocks are likely to be removed from the Nifty Next 50 index, if the exchange decides to tweak its computation methodology, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities.

These 11 stocks are Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, Bajaj Holdings, Adani Green Energy, Zomato, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, P&G Hygiene, LIC and Adani Wilmar.

Currently, these 11 stocks command 9.05 percent weight in the Nifty Next 50 index. Nifty Next 50 represents the next rung of liquid securities after the Nifty 50.

""The exposure of the index to non-F&O stocks frequently hitting the price bands, lowers the ability to replicate the index portfolio efficiently and thus increases the tracking error,"" according to Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

To resolve this, NSE Indices has floated a discussion paper and proposed that only stocks traded in the futures and options (F&O) segment be part of the index.

""Having only those stocks that are available for F&O trading into the Nifty Next 50 index shall improve the ease of replication of the index by passive funds,"" Pagaria said.

This could be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, to be implemented on June 30, these 11 stocks will see a reduction in their weight. From 9.05 percent, the cumulative weight for the non F&O stocks will come down to 5 percent.

In the second phase, to be implemented on September 30, the stocks will be deleted and a new set will be added.

""As of now, this is just a consultation and final implementation could be announced by exchange by third week of June,"" added Pagaria.

In the case of deletion, the 11 stocks that stand to get entry to Nifty Next 50 are Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent, Indian Hotels, TVS Motor Company, Cummins India, Jindal Steel and Power, Polycab, Punjab National Bank, Zydus Lifesciences and Abbott India.

Shriram Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Trent and Indian Hotels could see over $40 million of inflow due to this, according to Nuvama's calculations. These changes are key to tracking as many exchange-traded funds and index funds are benchmarked to it.

242	KEC	KEC International Ltd	KEC International bags two orders for Train Collision Avoidance System worth Rs 600 crore	"Vimal Kejriwal, MD & CEO of KEC International

Transmission tower manufacturer KEC International has got two orders for Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) aka the Kavach system, worth Rs 600 crore, MD and CEO Vimal Kejriwal told CNBC-TV18 on June 6. He added that while they haven’t seen many tenders yet, there is “tremendous scope for more”.

The KEC orders come after the recent tragic three-train collision in Balasore, Odisha, which has brought attention to the implementation of TCAS systems. The accident claimed 288 lives and injured around 1,000. It was reported that the route did not have Kavach.

Prospects big

Kejriwal expressed optimism about the future prospects of Kavach (TCAS) technology and highlighted the immense market potential for it. “The opportunity is very large, but we have not seen too many tenders or orders coming out of it. However, now with all the sound and fury about Kavach, I do expect that some more orders will get released, there is capacity if the orders are released,” he said.

Kavach is currently installed on a limited percentage of trains, estimated to be around 5-7 percent of the entire fleet. With approximately 20,000 trains in operation, the potential market size for train collision avoidance systems in India is substantial.

He added that KEC has entered into a strategic partnership with Kernex Micro to “enhance expertise and expand reach”. It aims to leverage the combined strengths of both companies to provide cutting-edge Kavach Systems.

Notably, Kavach was developed by the Railway Ministry’s Research Design and Standards Organisation, in collaboration with Medha Servo Drives, HBL Power Systems and Kernex Microsystems. It was brought under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative in the 2022 Union Budget.

Performance

In terms of financial projections, KEC anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent or higher this year, supported by an order book of over Rs 31,000 crore. Kejriwal said that KEC’s FY24 margin guidance is at 7 percent; with 6 percent in H1 and 8 percent in H2.

On the Brazilian operations, he noted that they had debt of $50 million, of which $25-30 million has been refinanced.

Regarding the company's exposure to the Afghan market, he shared that KEC has a net exposure of around Rs 250 crore. ""To date, we received nearly Rs 50 crore, with an agreement in place for an additional Rs 150 crore. The company is actively engaged in discussions with financial institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to secure the remaining amount,"" he added.

246	LT	Larsen & Toubro Ltd	ABB India shares at Rs 5,000? UBS upgrades stock to ‘Buy’. Here’s why	"Foreign brokerage UBS has upgraded ABB India shares to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' earlier, with a revised target of Rs 5,000 against Rs 3,770, suggesting a 21 per cent upside over June 9's closing value of Rs 4,148.90. Short-cycle demand for ABB's industrial products has been stronger than expected on the back of its deeper geographical penetration, UBS said.

Electrification and motion are set to lift margins even though ABB remains dependent on imports in process automation and robotics, it said adding that ABB India's Indian leadership is highly focused on expanding market opportunities, especially in low voltage electrification.

""While consensus margin forecasts have risen 120 bps in the past 12 months, we think ABB's true potential from value-accretive electrification and motion has yet to be priced in. A growing contribution from highly scalable new segments and products aid growth and OPM, supported by active capex,"" it said.

UBS said it remains bullish on industrial automation and low voltage electrification demand and sees an improving case for further operating profit margin growth.

""We lift margins by 130 bps and earnings by 10-17 per cent for CY23-25E, which we believe realistically reflects the sustainability of margins, driven by volume and revenue mix benefits from electrification and motion. Our CY24/25E earnings forecasts are 10 per cent/15 per cent ahead of consensus. We raise our price target from Rs 3,770 to Rs5,000, and upgrade the stock to Buy, based on a peak PE of 70 times (vs the 62 times earlier), pricing in the potential for greater growth-led capex,"" it said.

UBS' order of preferences in the industrial sector coverage is now Siemens, ABB India, Larsen & Toubro and BHEL.

With wide innovation-driven moats and high value-added products, ABB is extending its geographical reach in its leadership segments, such as motors, drives, low and medium voltage switches, and switchgears, which in UBS said have a lot more room to grow profitably.

Further momentum in service-layered long-term projects points to medium-to long-term growth in revenue share from high margin services, it said.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

246	LT	Larsen & Toubro Ltd	L&T, Nasscom, Tata Group back administrative allocation of spectrum for satcom services	"Larsen & Toubro, Nasscom and Tata Group entities are among those who have come out backing Elon Musk and Sunil Mittal over the issue of allocating spectrum for satellite communication services.

“The field of satellite communication is inherently intricate, and utilising auction-based models may result in outcomes that are less than optimal for the industry as a whole. Unlike conventional telecommunication services that mainly involve point-to-point communication, satellite communication necessitates substantial and contiguous spectrum blocks. An auction-based approach could potentially fragment the available spectrum, posing challenges for operators in delivering efficient services.,” L&T said in its submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

“Numerous nations have encountered setbacks in auctioning spectrum for satellite services. As an illustration, the UK government’s auction of the 2.3 GHz and 3.4 GHz spectrum for 5G services in 2018 failed to generate bids from prominent mobile operators. This failure was primarily attributed to the government’s establishment of lofty reserve prices. Comparable instances of unsuccessful auctions have been witnessed in countries including Australia, Germany,” L&T added.

‘Artificial limitation’

IT industry body, Nasscom, said satellite spectrum, unlike terrestrial spectrum, can be shared among multiple service providers without diminishing what is available to others. Due to its non-exclusive nature, the existing well-established administrative route is the most efficient method of allocation.

Nasscom said auctioning spectrum would create an artificial limitation of the number of satellite operators sharing spectrum and impact services like broadcasting and broadband. It will also create entry barriers and limit participation in the satcom sector to only a few players, because auctions are expensive and for many small players, making such heavy investments in an auction may not be feasible, it added.

Tata group entities, Nelco and Tata Play, have also said auctioning spectrum would be a bad idea. “Unlike the terrestrial spectrum, satellite spectrum can be used simultaneously by multiple service providers around the world on a non-exclusionary basis. In other words, multiple satellite operators can use the same spectrum without excluding others. Because of its non-exclusive nature, space spectrum is not scarce, with no risk of individual players grabbing it,” Nelco said.

‘Flexible purpose’

Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea are, however, convinced that spectrum has to be auctioned. Reliance Jio is of the view that with rapid advancement in technology, the distance between terrestrial- and space-based communication is reducing, therefore, satellite spectrum services is a more flexible purpose, and can be used interchangeably for both space and traditional telecommunication purposes. Therefore, satellite spectrum should be auctioned.

A key component to make satellite broadband services operational in the country is the allocation of spectrum. The leading players, who could start offering high-speed Internet services using satellite technology in India this year or next, are Sunil Bharti Mittal’s OneWeb and Elon Musk’s Starlink, who have complete low-earth orbit (LEO) constellations already operational in certain parts of the world such as Europe and North America.

While Reliance Jio has also thrown its hat into the satellite broadband race in partnership with SES in 2022, experts believe it wishes to block the entry of LEO broadband players into India."

259	L&TFH	L&T Finance Holdings Ltd	L&T Finance group focuses on retail, aims 25pc CAGR in 3-4yrs	"Larsen & Toubro Group's non-bank financing vertical aims to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 25 per cent predominantly by focusing on retail financing as a long-term strategy, a senior official said on Sunday.

With the current growth rate, the retail portfolio of the group is estimated to reach Rs 1,00,000 crore by FY2025-26.

""In FY23 we grew by 35 per cent. Our CAGR for the next few years will continue to be at least 25 per cent with the opportunities lying ahead,"" L&T Finance group CFO Sachinn Joshi told PTI.

L&T Finance Group would predominantly become a retail finance company in the long term, gradually reducing the wholesale book from its existing portfolio, which is around Rs 19,500 crore now,"" he said.

In the current fiscal year itself, he expects retail to reach 80 per cent of the total loan book, two years ahead of the target under its goal ""Lakshya.""



The group's non-banking finance companies' loan book currently stands at about Rs 81,000 crore spread across its group companies.

The share of retail in the total loan book is expected to scale up to about 90 per cent by FY'26 from around 75 per cent, fueled by streamlining with the ongoing corporate restructuring, according to a senior official.

The group is currently undergoing a restructuring process where it will amalgamate its finance subsidiaries, L&T Finance, L&T Infra Credit Limited, and L&T Mutual Fund Trustee Limited with the listed L&T Finance Holding Ltd to simplify the corporate structure and enable greater focus on retail financing. These wholly-owned subsidiaries have already received approval from the Reserve Bank of India.

Out of the total outstanding loan book of Rs 81,000 crore spread across its group companies, only Rs 4,500 crore is on the books of L&T Infra Credit Limited. L&T had hived off its mutual fund business to HSBC.

Joshi expects that its new businesses, like consumer loans, SME Finance, and home loans, will grow faster than the matured businesses. Rural group (microfinance), tractor loans, and two-wheeler loans are treated as matured and have cumulative assets of about Rs 40,500 crore.

He stated that the merger process would be completed within the current fiscal year, and post that, the management will explore dropping the word ""Holding"" from the company's name.

Asked about fundraising, Joshi said with loan portfolio churning, borrowing will remain limited in the current fiscal."	"With the current growth rate, the retail portfolio of the group is estimated to reach Rs 1,00,000 crore by FY2025-26.

Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.

The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.

""Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.

""The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,"" Shetti said.

In terms of dollars, gold and silver gained 0.7 and 3 per cent to close the week at $1,960.6 and $24.3 per ounce, respectively.

Similarly, on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures appreciated 0.4 per cent to end the week at ₹59,821 (per 10 gram). Silver futures was up 2.5 per cent as it closed at ₹73,796 (per kg).

MCX-Gold (₹59,821)

Gold futures (August series) was trading flat through last week. The contract was held in the narrow range of ₹59,400-60,150. Thus, the overall bear trend and the double-top pattern remain valid.

The chances are open for the contract to see a dip to ₹58,000. Support below this level is at ₹56,400, where the 200-day moving average lies. But if there is a recovery from here, gold futures is likely to face resistance at ₹61,000 and ₹62,000.

Trade strategy: We suggested going short two weeks ago at an average price of ₹59,780. Stop-loss was suggested at ₹61,000. Retain this trade.

When the contract touches ₹58,500, tighten the stop-loss to ₹59,500. Book profits at ₹58,050.

MCX-Silver (₹73,796)

Silver futures (July contract), which was flat in the first half of last week, gained positive momentum on Thursday and rallied and posted a gain of 2.5 per cent. Thus, silver futures outperformed gold futures.

From the current level, the nearest resistance region is the price band of ₹74,400 and ₹75,000. The 50-day moving average lies at ₹74,400. Only a rally past ₹75,000 will turn the trend positive. In such a case, there might be a rally towards another resistance band of ₹78,300-78,700.

But if the contract resumes the decline, it might fall to ₹70,000, a support. Subsequent support is at ₹67,300.

Trade strategy: We suggested short positions at an average price of ₹71,615. Stop-loss of this trade at ₹73,200 was hit last week. Although the bears seem to loosen grip, there is no confirmation of a bullish reversal yet. So, stay away until a clear sign occurs."

261	MCX	Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd	Crude Check: Crude Oil Faces Volatility and Weekly Loss, Range-bound Outlook	"Crude oil witnessed volatile sessions over the past week and eventually posted a weekly loss. The Brent crude futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) lost 1.6 per cent as it ended the week at $74.8 a barrel. Likewise, the MCX crude oil futures (July contract) was down 1.3 per cent last week as it closed at ₹5,866 per barrel on Friday.

There was an expectation that the OPEC+ could go for a cut in oil production. But in their latest meeting held last Sunday, they decided to stick to the 2023 production targets. Yet, Saudi Arabia announced a voluntary one-month one million barrels per day cut, which can be extended. While this instilled some volatility in prices, it did not help establish a trend.

Similarly, the inventory data of the US released last week, too, failed to guide crude oil in either direction. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the inventory dropped by 0.5 million barrels versus the expected increase of 1.2 million barrels.

The chart, too, shows that the energy commodity is stuck in a range, struggling to find direction.

MCX-Crude oil (₹5,866)

The July futures of crude oil faced hurdle at ₹6,075 and fell off this level and closed the week at ₹5,866. Thus, the narrow range of ₹5,750-6,075 and the broader range of ₹5,580-6,200 remain valid. Unless the contract moves out of the broader range, we cannot assume the next leg of trend.

The risk seems to be evenly balanced and so, the crude oil futures is likely to stay within the range for some more time.

In case the contract breaks out of ₹6,200, we might see a quick rally to ₹6,500 — the nearest barrier. Resistance above this level is at ₹6,800. On the other hand, if the price drops below ₹5,580, it can find a support immediately at ₹5,500. A breach of this level can drag the contract to ₹5,280.

Trade strategy: Since the trend is not clear, stay on the side lines. Yet, traders with high-risk appetite can go long if the price moderates to ₹5,600. Target and stop-loss can be at ₹5,980 and ₹5,480 respectively."	"Crude oil witnessed volatile sessions over the past week and eventually posted a weekly loss.

263	MAHINDCIE	Mahindra CIE Automotive Ltd	Technical Analysis: Eicher Motors, Mahindra CIE Automotive, and Sharda Cropchem	"Eicher Motors (₹3,582.1)

Signs of a short-term fall

Eicher Motors’ stock, which took support at ₹2,850 in early April, has been on a rally since then. But after hitting the resistance at ₹3,700 three weeks ago, the stock lost momentum and started moving in a sideways trend. Notably, it declined last week, and the chart shows that the stock has formed an evening star candlestick pattern.

Considering this pattern and that there is a resistance at ₹3,700, the likelihood of a decline from here looks high. The price could possibly drop to ₹3,250. Hence, one can go short on Eicher Motors at the current level of ₹3,582. Add more shorts if the price inches up to ₹3,640. Place stop-loss at ₹3,800 initially. When the price falls below ₹3,400, alter the stop-loss to ₹3,525. Book profits at ₹3,250.

Mahindra CIE Automotive (₹506.6)

Shows good upward momentum

Mahindra CIE Automotive’s share price has been on a long-term uptrend. The latest leg of uptrend began in April at around ₹335. Last week, the stock showed good bullish momentum as it ended the week on a high note. It has closed above the key level of ₹500. Considering the prevailing price action, the likelihood of an extended rally from here is high.

Therefore, we recommend buying the stock of Mahindra CIE Automotive at the current level of about ₹507. Accumulate more shares if the price dips to ₹495. Keep initial stop-loss at ₹475. When the stock rallies to ₹540, exit half of the longs. For the remaining positions, revise the stop-loss up to ₹510. Liquidate the rest at ₹560.

Sharda Cropchem (₹555.8)

Breaches a key level

Sharda Cropchem’s stock has been largely tracing a sideways trend since the beginning of this year. That is, it was oscillating between ₹440 and ₹534. Last week, the stock garnered enough momentum leading to a decisive break out of the barrier at ₹534. This has opened the doors for further rally. Potentially, Sharda Cropchem’s share price can rise to ₹700 in the coming weeks.

Yet, there is a good chance for the stock to soften to ₹534 before the next leg of rally. So, go long now at ₹556 and add more longs if the price corrects to ₹534. Place stop-loss at ₹480 initially. Modify the stop-loss to ₹595 when the stock surpasses ₹625. Further, when the stock rallies past ₹660, tighten the stop-loss to ₹630. Exit at ₹690."	"Eicher Motors (₹3,582.1)Signs of a short-term fallEicher Motors’ stock, which took support at ₹2,850 in early April, has been on a rally since then.
Hence, one can go short on Eicher Motors at the current level of ₹3,582.
Mahindra CIE Automotive (₹506.6)Shows good upward momentumMahindra CIE Automotive’s share price has been on a long-term uptrend.

264	MARICO	Marico Ltd	Marico stock hovering near 52-week high	"The stock of FMCG player Marico has been on a roller-coaster ride since May. From declining 1 per cent on May 5 to jumping 8 per cent on May 8, the stock came close to its 52-week high on couple of occasions in the last few days.

With the IMD predicting a normal monsoon this year, the market sees an upside for Marico. Though the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has flagged concerns about El Nino uncertainties which may lead to food inflation impacting the performance of FMCG stocks on the bourses, the primary trend of Marico seems to be bullish as many analysts and brokerages are giving a Buy/Accumulate call on this stock.

Shares of Marico fell 0.79 per cent to ₹545.45 on Thursday. Earlier in the day, it hit an intra-day high of ₹551.10 – just 2.3 per cent away from its 52-week high price of ₹558.75.

Abhishek Jain, Head of Research, Arihant Capital, told businessline, “With declining raw material prices over the past few weeks and a promising outlook for FY24 based on management commentary post the Q4FY23 call, the stock has gained an impressive 15-17 per cent, making it a standout performer in the sector. As the pressure on raw material prices eases off, Marico is expected to witness improved margins in the future.”

The company’s value-added hair oil segment has also demonstrated strong growth, registering a remarkable 13 per cent increase and showcasing consecutive quarters of gross margin expansion. “Considering these factors, we maintain a positive outlook on Marico and recommend buying on market declines,” he added.

Profit-booking on Thursday

“The stock witnessed a rally of over 20 per cent since April, but over the past few days, it has witnessed profit booking and selling pressure at higher levels. Investors had moved into the defensives post global recession fears, and also on the back of strong consumer demand uptick,” said Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel One.

Gaurav Bissa, Vice-President of InCred Equities, told businessline: “One of the prominent reasons for a strong upside in Marico has been the strong breakout seen in Nifty FMCG index on the weekly charts. The stock has witnessed some profit booking today, which was also seen in many of the sectoral as well as broader market indices. However, the stock continues to trade comfortably above the breakout area implying further upside can be possible till it holds 520 levels. The stock can attempt fresh lifetime-high levels once it gives a weekly close above 560.”

Elara Securities has revised its ratings from Buy to Accumulate, while Prabhudas Lilladher recommends an Accumulate with a target price of ₹550.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

272	MARUTI	Maruti Suzuki India Ltd	Maruti Suzuki Jimny Reaches Mod Shops, Modified With 20-inch Alloy Wheels - Watch	"Maruti Suzuki Jimny is loved by enthusiasts across the globe for its looks. The SUV looks cute and tiny, but packs in a tuning potential that can help it sport the G-Wagen lines. The Indian market has recently seen the introduction of the Jimny. The deliveries have started in full swing. Thus, owners are reaching mod shops to get their possessions customised. Recently, we came across a modified example of the Maruti Suzuki Jimny that dons a set of 20-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The video was uploaded on Instagram by Monga Tyres, who are based out of Ludhiana, Punjab.

In the clip, the 5-door off-roader is visible with larger mag wheels. A 5-spoke design for the new alloy wheels is chosen by the owner. Thanks to the Jimny’s large squarish wheel arches, the rims fit well with sufficient space left in the wheel well for articulation. The Jimny comes with a 15-inch rim from the factory, which is wrapped in 195-80 section tyre. Although the tyre size is small and puny, it is a highway-rated tyre. Consequently, more owners are expected to slap on off-road-ready rubber on the Jimny.

Powering the Jimny is a 1.5L K-series engine with Idle Start Stop technology and tuned to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission option. It offers a fuel-efficiency of 16.94 kmpl for 5-speed MT and 16.39 kmpl for 4-speed AT and comes with a permanent ALLGRIP PRO (4WD). The 4WD system comprises a low-range transfer case and solid axles on both ends. The Jimny also gets brake-locking differential for increased capabilities.

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCI Express

TCIE has established itself as a leading logistics player with a pan-India reach, which gives the company an advantage against competition. The company focuses on the profitable B2B segment, which accounts for ~95% of its business. It also has a good blend of customers, with 50% of its revenue coming from SMEs and the balance from Corporates. Over the years, TCIE has developed a robust Hub-and-Spoke infrastructure, comprising over 950 owned centers across 60,000 locations in the country. While new segments, Rail Express and C2C Express, are small parts of its overall business but are growing at a fast pace. TCIE expects these high-margin segments to form nearly 25% of its overall business in FY25 from ~18% currently. After commissioning an automated center in Gurugram in FY22, TCIE is looking to automate the Pune facility in FY24. It would improve the turnaround time and reduce costs. During FY23, TCIE incurred capex of INR1.25b, primarily for the purchase of land in Kolkata and Ahmedabad to set up new automated sorting center, a new corporate office in Gurgaon, and the network expansion by adding 35 new branches in key growing markets in the West and South regions.



Outlook

We expect TCIE to achieve volume/revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 11%/13%/21%/21% over FY23-25, aided by automation and the transition from rental sorting centers to an owned model, resulting in better operating efficiency. TCIE plans to incur capex of INR5b over next five years for setting up its own sorting centers. It intends to have its own sorting centers in 11 cities by FY26. With targeted capex, a debt-free balance sheet and a focus on the highly profitable B2B segment, the outlook for TCIE looks bright. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,850, based on 35x FY25E EPS.

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

The analysis of TCS AR23 not only highlights the widespread adoption of digital technologies in customer-facing operations, but also the increasing penetration of AI and automation in middle and back-office operations. With the growing intensity of adverse macro-economic environment in the latter half of the year, the clients are reprioritizing their spends and expressing interest in transforming their operating model. Apart from demand for driving operational efficiency and optimizing costs, Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY23. Despite demonstrating strong resilience, TCS anticipates the possibility of a moderate full-year revenue growth in FY24 if similar instances of delayed decision-making and cash conservation from clients reoccur.



Outlook

We maintain our positive stance on TCS. Our TP of INR 3,860 implies 25x FY25E EPS, with a 20% upside potential. We reiterate our BUY rating.

280	MPHASIS	Mphasis Ltd	Trade setup for Wednesday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The recovery in late trade amid consolidation helped the market close flat with a positive bias on June 6, as the three-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee members started a discussion over interest rate decisions.

The benchmark indices continued the uptrend for the third consecutive session. The BSE Sensex was up 5.4 points at 62,793, while the Nifty50 rose 5.2 points to 18,599 and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating the tug-of-war between bulls and bears for market direction as the closing was similar to opening levels.

""Normally, such Doji formations after a reasonable up move or down move calls for reversal. Having formed this pattern amidst a range movement, the predictive value of this pattern could be less,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He feels immediate supports like daily 10 and 20-day EMAs (exponential moving average) are intact and the intraday buying has been emerging so far from this support in the short term.

On the upper side, repeated testing of crucial hurdle around the 18,600-18,700 levels is expected to result in a decisive upside breakout, while immediate support is at 18,500 levels, Shetti said.

We have seen a continued uptrend in broader markets with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 0.06 percent and 0.54 percent, respectively.

We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:

Note: The open interest (OI) and volume data of stocks in this article are the aggregates of three-month data and not just the current month.

Key support, resistance levels on Nifty

The Nifty may get support at 18,550, followed by 18,528 and 18,493. If the index advances, then 18,619 will be the key resistance followed by 18,641 and 18,676.

Nifty Bank

We have also seen an upward journey in the Bank Nifty for the third day in a row. The index climbed 63 points to 44,165 amid volatility and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale for yet another session.

""The Doji candle formation suggests that the overall trend is expected to remain sideways, without a clear direction in the index's movement,"" Rupak De, Senior Technical at LKP Securities said.

He feels the support level is identified at 44,000 and if the index falls below this level, it might drop towards 43,700. On the other hand, the resistance levels are observed at 44,300 and 44,500 acting as barriers to further upward movement, he said.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,050, followed by 43,997 and 43,910, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,223, then 44,277 and 44,363.

Call options data

On the weekly options front, the maximum Call open interest (OI) was at 18,600 strike, with 1.01 crore contracts, which is expected to be a crucial resistance level for the Nifty.

On the Put side, the maximum open interest was at 18,500 strike, with 1 crore contracts, which is expected to be an important support level in the coming sessions.

It was followed by the 18,600 strike, comprising 93.86 lakh contracts and the 18,400 strike with 70.35 lakh contracts.

Stocks with high delivery percentage

A high delivery percentage suggests that investors are showing interest in the stock. The highest delivery was seen in Larsen & Toubro, Petronet LNG, Cummins India, Coal India and United Breweries among others.

45 stocks see a long build-up

An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions. Based on the OI percentage, 45 stocks, including JK Cement, Maruti Suzuki India, ACC, Tata Communications and Syngene International saw long buildups.

28 stocks see long unwinding

A decline in OI and price generally indicate a long unwinding. Based on the OI percentage, 28 stocks, including Birlasoft, Escorts, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, Hindustan Copper and Oracle Financial saw a long unwinding.

58 stocks see a short build-up

An increase in OI along with a price decrease indicates a build-up of short positions. Based on the OI percentage, 58 stocks, including Mphasis, Indian Energy Exchange, Persistent Systems, Chambal Fertilizers and Aarti Industries saw a short build-up.

280	MPHASIS	Mphasis Ltd	IT stocks: Weak EPAM guidance sends Persistent, Mphasis, Coforge, Cyient shares falling; TCS, Infosys down 2% each	"Concerns over demand slowdown in discretionary spending in IT sector sent many midcap IT shares such as Persistent Systems, Mphasis, Coforge and Cyient tumbling in Tuesday's trade, even as largecap stocks such as TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech restricted losses. This is as US-based EPAM Systems cut its Calendar 2023 revenue growth outlook again, expecting a 2 per cent decline in revenues in the constant currency terms at the mid-point of the guided band.

Analysts noted that EPAM has been hit by high exposure to discretionary spending and certain company-specific factors and that domestic Indian IT firms have a more balanced portfolio between discretionary and maintenance spending.

Yet, ""we believe the recent run-up in the sector has been ahead of fundamentals,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. ""We believe that upsides do exist in Infosys and HCL Technologies but are wary of other names,"" it added.

Shares of Persistent Systems plunged 4.62 per cent to Rs 4,973.50. Coforge shares slipped 3.82 per cent to Rs 4,418. 40. Mphasis, Cyient and Zensar Technologies declined 3.71 per cent, 3.10 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively. LTIMindtree dropped 2.14 per cent to Rs 4,838. Among largecaps, Tech Mahindra also declined 2.20 per cent ti Rs 1,084. TCS fell 1.81 per cent while Infosys skidded 2 per cent. HCL Tech and WIpro declined 1.4 per cent each.

""Delays in client decision-making and pullbacks in discretionary spending have implications for the growth of Indian IT. We expect revenues in 1QFY24E to be weaker than 4QFY23 across companies in our coverage universe. We believe that the demand environment is especially weak in the financial services and technology segments. A prolonged recovery in clients’ willingness to spend would imply downside risks to FY2024 revenue growth estimates. Noting the weak demand, we are surprised by the rally in stock prices across our coverage in the past month,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The brokerage said Indian IT will benefit from cost take-out programs and mega-deals. However, these positives are outweighed by the broader caution in spending, especially in the impacted verticals, it said.

""SaaS and digital engineering companies’ commentary and revenue guidance suggests weak demand in the Jun’23 quarter with subsequent revival of demand in H2FY24/H2CY23 because, even though the sales cycle is lengthening, pipeline is not shrinking. Plus, there is demand from cost optimisation opportunities,"" said ICICIdirect.

This brokerage believes that weakness in revenue growth in 2023 is largely priced in the stock prices at current valuations, with Nifty IT index trading at 22 times one-year forward EPS, 2 epr cent premium to 5-year average PE.

""We continue to prefer Infosys (BUY) and Persistent Systems (BUY), followed by LTIMindtree (BUY) and TCS (BUY),"" it said.

The waste, also known as CBG feedstock, will be collected from hotels, restaurants, banquet halls, and large vegetable markets/mandis in the city. The feedstock supply will be managed by BMC and will include collection, segregation and delivery.

The plant on completion will provide a three-in-one solution, functioning as a biomass waste treatment plant, an organic fertiliser production plant and a green fuel production unit. The compressed biogas produced by the plant will be consumed within the city, it said without disclosing how much will be the energy generation.

This is just the first step towards moving to cleaner energy sources and will be critical for improving the quality of life through greener methods. Involving school students is the best way ahead, by instilling in them the value of sustainability from an early age, said Deepak Kesarkar, guardian minister of Mumbai.

Joining him, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, the guardian minister of Mumbai suburban district said this plant benefits both BMC and MGL since it not only reduces waste and helps enhance people's quality of life, but also serves as a clean source of energy generation.

The municipal commissioner and BMC administrator Iqbal Singh Chahal said the project is part of the BMC's mandate to regulate not only legacy waste but also daily waste.

MGL chairman Mahesh Iyer said the signing of the MoU for the plant is the result of nearly six months of effort. The plant that will be built in Mumbai and get us closer to attaining the petroleum ministry's objective of establishing 5,000 CBG plants in the country while also managing cities' daily waste.

It can also help us become less reliant on imported gas, which forms almost half of the country's gas consumption, he added.

Ashu Shinghal, the managing director of Mahanagar Gas, said the company is looking at achieving nine of the sustainable development goals through the plant --generating clean energy, mitigating the effects of climate change, reducing poverty and increasing employment."

284	NHPC	NHPC Ltd	NHPC inks MoU with Maharashtra for renewable energy projects	"State-run NHPC on Wednesday said that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Department of Energy, Maharashtra for the development of Pumped Storage schemes and other Renewable Energy (RE) source projects in the state.

The MOU envisages development of four Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) aggregating to 7,350 megawatts (MW), namely Kalu (1,150 MW), Savitri (2,250 MW), Jalond (2,400 MW) and Kengadi (1,550 MW) as well as other RE source projects in the State. The MoU was signed on Tuesday, the hydro power major said.

R K Vishnoi, CMD of NHPC, expressed his gratitude to the Maharashtra government for reposing their trust towards NHPC for the development of PSPs in the state. “This shall be a stepping-start of NHPC in Maharashtra. These projects will attract an investment of about ₹44,000 crores and nearly 7,000 indirect and direct jobs in the state,” he added.

The MoU entails harnessing the Pump Storage Projects as Energy Storage Solutions to achieve the national objective of Energy Transition—500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and Net Zero by 2070.

The MoU in the presence of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was signed by NHPC Director (Projects) Biswajit Basu, and Maharashtra Principal Secretary (Energy) Abha Shukla.

In April this year, the Power Ministry issued guidelines for pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) projects, and kick started around 5 gigawatt (GW) of capacity addition over the next five fiscal years. Rising capacity share of renewable energy produced during non-peak hours is making investments in storage infrastructure an imperative.

According to Crisil, PHES projects, which can be set up at ₹7-8 crore per MW, are viable at a levelised tariff of ₹6-7 per unit, assuming input power is available at ₹2.5-3 per unit, at 75-80 per cent cycle efficiency, debt to equity ratio of 70:30 and interest cost of 8-9 per cent. However, the tariffs could vary depending on the location, which could impact capital cost."

287	NAVINFLUOR	Navin Fluorine International Ltd	SRF, GFCL, Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine: How have they fared and which stock to buy?	"The past years have been transformational for speciality chemicals players, and the narrative in Q4FY23 results points to continued growth in some areas, while challenges are emerging in a few areas. Capex plans continue to be on the higher side, supported by past capex bearing results. New product lines and categories are being added across companies, but some existing lines may face volatility in the short term. We have analyzed the fourth quarter results of the five largest companies in the sector for a consolidated view.

Demand for value-added products

The big five – SRF, Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFCL), Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine – in order of market capitalization, have reported divergent revenue growth ranging from 5 to 70 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter. In SRF and Deepak Nitrite, which reported lower revenue growth, the main segments (speciality chemicals and phenols, respectively) continue to deliver double-digit growth with weakness in other segments, resulting in 5-6 per cent YoY growth on a consolidated basis.

Value-added products, including refrigerant gases, contractual products and downstream applications, reported strong demand visibility. Refrigerant gases gained from shortage-related price hikes in the past. But as developed markets phase out production and consumption, global demand for the same from Indian manufacturers should sustain. Companies offering contractual development (CDMO) – SRF and Navin, reported operationalising client/product-specific plants with visibility of continued additions into the future. Flourine-related chemistries spanning SRF, Navin and GFCL continue to have strong demand visibility.

On the contrary, industry-specific, commoditised product lines – textiles, packaging for SRF, dyes/pigments for Deepak Nitrite, consumer discretionary for Atul and Aarti or even generic agrochemical/pharma intermediaries manufacturers, reported a weak demand environment. High-interest rates, channel stocking or inventory rationalisation could be seen as a reason. While volume growth may be positive, pricing may remain weak through FY24. This should moderate consolidated margins in the short term from earlier higher levels.

Capex remains secularly high

Speciality chemicals, a capex-driven narrative, continue to be in a high investment mode. GFCL has added fluoropolymer lines and expects a significant contribution from FY25. The company is investing ₹1,000 - ₹1,500 crore per fiscal in FY22-24, and the capex will be focused on fluoropolymers. SRF will be operationalising its first line of fluoropolymers in H2FY24 and is eyeing products further down the line. New dedicated lines for advanced intermediaries in agrochem and pharma will be added along with new-age products for SRF. Navin expects a higher run rate of existing CDMO plants and expects to add furthermore. All three companies will add higher capacity for refrigerant gases, potentially leading to overinvestment in the space if the volume growth does not pan out (companies are confident of demand strength, though).

Deepak Nitrites is also eyeing capex of ₹2,500 crore over the next three years, which should improve its phenols business-related downstream applications and backward integration. Similarly, Tata Chemicals which also operates at the base chemicals level, plans on ₹2,000 crore capex for the next three years, which should improve soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and silica capacities. Similar to complex fluoropolymers of other companies, Tata Chemicals base products are also eyeing a multifold growth in solar, electric vehicle, fuel cells and other new age applications for growth in demand. On the other hand, capex plans of companies reliant on commoditised products, which are facing a short-term slowdown in demand, may face lower returns from invested capital if the slowdown extends beyond the short term.

The valuation range of the sector is wide, starting from 23 to 46 times FY24 earnings (excluding Tata Chemicals, which trades at ten times owing to its basic chemicals nature). The higher-than-market range (18-20 times FY24 earnings for Nifty) is owing to the capex mode the companies are in. We recently recommended investors accumulate SRF. Earlier, we also recommended investors buy GFCL stock when trading at₹2,770. The stocks are trading at reasonable multiples given growth prospects (23 times for GFCL and 30 times for SRF), operate at the upper end of the value chain, and invest in the right areas (away from consumer discretionary space facing lower demand). But one must constantly monitor the ‘new demand’ from Europe, import replacement, and new clients/products to justify the valuation range."

287	NAVINFLUOR	Navin Fluorine International Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The market has seen a gap-up opening and remained in the positive terrain throughout the session on June 7, as buying interest was seen across sectors.

New India Assurance Company Ltd rallied 2 percent in afternoon trade on June 7 on an increase in its market share in the general insurance sector in the month of May.

The largest government-owned general insurance player grew 9.67 percent to Rs 2,421 crore in May, with its market share improving to 18.51 percent from 17.07 percent in the year-ago period.

At 1.03 pm, the stock was trading 1.90 percent higher at Rs 120.50 on National Stock Exchange.

Q4 performance

The company’s global gross written premium rose 5.3 percent to Rs 38,791 crore in the March quarter of FY 23 from the year-ago period.

The net earned premium has jumped 4.59 percent YoY to Rs 31,127 crore. Profit after tax (PAT) has jumped by 543.29 percent to Rs 1,055 crore YoY, the insurer said in a BSE filing.

Management commentary

CMD Neerja Kapur said after a challenging FY22, where the company’s performance was adversely affected by COVID claims, it delivered good results in FY23.

The gross written premium increased by only 5.3 percent as the company pursued its strategy of growth with profitability, which meant that the company had let go of some businesses where the price was not adequate, she said. The underwriting results were negatively impacted to an extent of Rs 224 crore due to adverse development of claims pertaining to previous years in the crop line of business, she said.

CAT losses in foreign operations in the fourth quarter also negatively impacted the results, with the full-year results getting adversely impacted by Rs 107 crore.

In FY23, the company absorbed the entire impact of wage arrears and additional provisioning on account of employee benefits to the extent of Rs 3,445 crore, which was partially offset by investment income due to good market conditions.

“Operationally, the company looks forward to an improved performance in FY24 in terms of premium growth, loss ratio, combined ratio as well as profits,” she said.

The company has rolled out its price increases in retail health after a gap of six years. The pricing in the group health segment has been tightened.

The motor portfolio is witnessing growth once again after many years of muted performance and steps are being taken to reduce its loss ratio, the CMD said.

“The revised product filing guidelines have ensured that the time to market for new products has decreased significantly. The company will be launching several new products in the coming year,” she said.

Stock performance

New India Assurance has given a return of 14.55 percent over the last six months, outperforming the Nifty, which gained 0.75 percent in the same period.

300	NMDC	NMDC Ltd	Technical Analysis: J.K. Cement, NMDC, and Himatsingka Seide Stocks	"What is the outlook for J.K. Cement? Shall I enter the stock at current levels?

Ashish Pathrabe

J.K. Cement (₹3,221): You have not mentioned the time frame for which you would intend to remain invested in this stock. We give here an analysis on the stock of J.K. Cement for a period of one-three months. The short-term outlook is bullish. The share price has been moving up since February this year, but very gradually. This upmove seems to have gained strength over the last couple of weeks. Support is in the ₹3,150-3,100 region. Below that, ₹3,000 is the next strong support.

J.K. Cement share price can rise to ₹3,500-3,600 over the next three months or even before that. You can buy this stock now if you want to play it for a three-month time-frame. Accumulate on dips at ₹3,160. Keep the stop-loss at ₹3,040. Trail the stop-loss up to ₹3,260 when the price rises to ₹3,330. Move the stop-loss further up to ₹3,370 when the price touches ₹3,420. Exit the share at ₹3,490. Please note that this is a very short-term outlook. So, make sure to adhere to the stop-loss and target levels.

I have purchased the shares of NMDC at ₹120. I can hold it for another six months. Can I buy more at current levels? What is the outlook?

S. Manoharan, Chennai

NMDC (₹107.60): This stock has been in a prolonged sideways move. It has been oscillating in a wide range of ₹50-150 for more than a decade since 2012. Within this range, the stock went up to ₹131.85 in January this year and has come down from there. However, the pace of fall has slowed down over the last couple of months. Support is at ₹102. If the stock manages to gain strength and move up from here, it can rise to ₹120. A sustained break above ₹120 can take it further up to ₹140.

But a break below ₹102 from here will be bearish. Such a break can drag the NMDC share price down to ₹85-80. It is not advisable to accumulate at current levels. Instead, you keep a stop-loss at ₹98 and hold the stock. Move the stop-loss up to ₹112 when the stock moves up to ₹120. Move the stop-loss further up to ₹122 when the price touches ₹130. Exit the stock at ₹135.

I have shares of Himatsingka Seide. My average purchase price is ₹241. Can I hold this stock for long term? What is the outlook?

Vikram

Himatsingka Seide (₹102.06): The downtrend that was in place since October 2021 has reversed. The stock has formed a double bottom around ₹68 earlier this year and has seen a strong rise recently. From long-term perspective, this is a strong bullish signal. The stock has supports at ₹93 and ₹80. Himatsingka Seide share price can rise to ₹130-150 over the next three-six months. Thereafter, a corrective fall to ₹100 is a possibility. But the long-term picture will remain positive.

An eventual break above ₹150 can take the stock price up to ₹220 by mid-2024. Since you intend to hold the stock for a long term, you can consider accumulating more at current levels so that your average purchase price comes down below ₹200. Keep a stop-loss at ₹84. Revise the stop-loss up to ₹95 when the price moves up to ₹120. Move the stop-loss further up to ₹150 when the price reaches ₹180. Exit the stock at ₹210.

Another 24 kms of pipes have already arrived which have not been aligned and only 24 kms of pipes are due to arrive,” said Amitava Mukherjee, chairman and managing director (additional charge) and director (finance) of NMDC. He said the entire system would be ready for use by 2025. The sanction cost of the slurry pipeline is around Rs 2900 crore and is going to go up to Rs 3500 crore, he said.

The National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) is in line to set up two slurry pipelines from Nagarnar in Bastar district, where the company’s demerged entity NMDC Steel (NSL) had set up a plant. Of the three mechanised iron ore mines that NMDC operates, two are in the state’s Dantewada district. The Bailadila project in the district has two iron ore complexes — Kirandul and Bacheli — from where it plans to feed the 3 million tonnes (mt) per annum steel plant at Nagarnar. The company is in the works to set up a 131-km-long slurry pipeline to carry iron ore from Bailadila mines to Nagarnar in a bid to reduce dependence on railways.The non-availability of rakes had posed a major challenge for the miner as the delay in dispatch casts shadow on the produ­cti­on with a very limited cap­ac­ity of storage because the mines are loc­ated on hilltops. NMDC will complete the feasibility of the two slurry pipelines and execute the projects, if viable, once the on-going work is completed.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

310	PEL	Piramal Enterprises Ltd	Piramal Enterprises looks at sustained growth, profitability: Chairman	"Piramal Enterprises is looking at sustained growth and profitability with the last few years spent in making balance sheets and businesses more resilient to tide over unforeseen uncertainties, according to Chairman Ajay G Piramal.

In his address to shareholders in Annual Report for 2022-23, the business leader said the efforts over the last years have shown positive results with the group ending the last fiscal with a net profit of Rs 9,969 crore and total assets of Rs 83,386 crore.

''We are now focused on sustained growth and profitability and to achieve our balance between three pillars - Growth, Risk and Profitability,'' Piramal stated.

Focused business entities ensure not only focus in terms of business strategies but also help strengthen and ensure efficient use of our capital and human resources, he added.

''We are certain that the consequent long-term value creation for all stakeholders will be achieved by strategically selecting our specialised bets in retail and wholesale backed by cutting-edge technology, assiduous risk management and exceptional leadership,'' Piramal said.

He noted that creating two separate pure-play entities in the financial services and pharmaceuticals has resulted in a stronger governance architecture, with dedicated Board and management teams for the two businesses.

''The demerger allows us to ensure optimal capital structures for each business and will facilitate the businesses to grow independently, by pursuing both organic and inorganic growth plans,'' he added.

Piramal stated that in FY2023, the group's businesses have demonstrated a resilient performance while navigating the global macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. The company continues on its stated path of implementing renewed strategies to drive sustainable growth, he added.

''The company's major transformation exercise saw fruition in FY2023, and it is the foundation on which sustainable growth will accrue in the coming time,'' Piramal said.

The group completed a one-year milestone of the DHFL acquisition and its integration, thereby driving growth and diversification of the business, progressing towards making it more retail-oriented.

In Wholesale, the group has completed the asset recognition cycle, adequately providing for assets and creating a healthy provisioning buffer.

''In real estate, we will focus on large and medium-sized developers, wherein 49 per cent of the projects are in late-stage or completed. Leveraging our retail setup, we will also be selectively entering into Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets, which are relatively under-penetrated,'' Piramal stated.

He noted that the group remains confident about the long-term success of the financial services business, as it inches closer towards its FY27 stated aspirations.

''PEL with its unique business model, size and balance sheet strength is poised to tap growth opportunities profitably and create sustainable long-term value,'' Piramal said.

Piramal Group has a presence across the pharma, financial services and real estate sectors.

It has offices in over 30 countries and a global brand presence in more than 100 markets.

We have also seen an upward journey in the Bank Nifty for the third day in a row. The index climbed 63 points to 44,165 amid volatility and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale for yet another session.

He feels the support level is identified at 44,000 and if the index falls below this level, it might drop towards 43,700. On the other hand, the resistance levels are observed at 44,300 and 44,500 acting as barriers to further upward movement, he said.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 44,050, followed by 43,997 and 43,910, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,223, then 44,277 and 44,363.

315	PERSISTENT	Persistent Systems Ltd	IT stocks: Weak EPAM guidance sends Persistent, Mphasis, Coforge, Cyient shares falling; TCS, Infosys down 2% each	"Concerns over demand slowdown in discretionary spending in IT sector sent many midcap IT shares such as Persistent Systems, Mphasis, Coforge and Cyient tumbling in Tuesday's trade, even as largecap stocks such as TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech restricted losses. This is as US-based EPAM Systems cut its Calendar 2023 revenue growth outlook again, expecting a 2 per cent decline in revenues in the constant currency terms at the mid-point of the guided band.

Analysts noted that EPAM has been hit by high exposure to discretionary spending and certain company-specific factors and that domestic Indian IT firms have a more balanced portfolio between discretionary and maintenance spending.

Yet, ""we believe the recent run-up in the sector has been ahead of fundamentals,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. ""We believe that upsides do exist in Infosys and HCL Technologies but are wary of other names,"" it added.

Shares of Persistent Systems plunged 4.62 per cent to Rs 4,973.50. Coforge shares slipped 3.82 per cent to Rs 4,418. 40. Mphasis, Cyient and Zensar Technologies declined 3.71 per cent, 3.10 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively. LTIMindtree dropped 2.14 per cent to Rs 4,838. Among largecaps, Tech Mahindra also declined 2.20 per cent ti Rs 1,084. TCS fell 1.81 per cent while Infosys skidded 2 per cent. HCL Tech and WIpro declined 1.4 per cent each.

""Delays in client decision-making and pullbacks in discretionary spending have implications for the growth of Indian IT. We expect revenues in 1QFY24E to be weaker than 4QFY23 across companies in our coverage universe. We believe that the demand environment is especially weak in the financial services and technology segments. A prolonged recovery in clients’ willingness to spend would imply downside risks to FY2024 revenue growth estimates. Noting the weak demand, we are surprised by the rally in stock prices across our coverage in the past month,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The brokerage said Indian IT will benefit from cost take-out programs and mega-deals. However, these positives are outweighed by the broader caution in spending, especially in the impacted verticals, it said.

""SaaS and digital engineering companies’ commentary and revenue guidance suggests weak demand in the Jun’23 quarter with subsequent revival of demand in H2FY24/H2CY23 because, even though the sales cycle is lengthening, pipeline is not shrinking. Plus, there is demand from cost optimisation opportunities,"" said ICICIdirect.

This brokerage believes that weakness in revenue growth in 2023 is largely priced in the stock prices at current valuations, with Nifty IT index trading at 22 times one-year forward EPS, 2 epr cent premium to 5-year average PE.

""We continue to prefer Infosys (BUY) and Persistent Systems (BUY), followed by LTIMindtree (BUY) and TCS (BUY),"" it said.

316	PNB	Punjab National Bank	Here’s how you can make UPI payments without internet using IVR	"The popularity of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments has made it a crucial component of digital transactions. Whether its local vendors or high street shops, everyone relies on it for swift money transfers. However, areas with limited internet connectivity, particularly rural regions, face a challenge in adopting UPI. To address this issue, Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Monday launched UPI 123PAY, an IVR-based UPI solution. This innovative solution allows users with any type of phone, even in low internet connectivity zones, to perform UPI transactions.

UPI123PAY, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), facilitates UPI payments for feature phones, eliminating the requirement for an internet connection. Last year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced 123PAY, a service enabling feature phone users to engage in a variety of transactions utilizing four different technological options. They include calling an IVR (interactive voice response) number, app functionality in feature phones, missed call-based approach and also proximity sound-based payments.

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a 24*7 payment channel enabling customers to perform fast, encrypted and real-time payments. Till now, the solution was accessible only through smartphones or through Unstructured Supplementary Service data (USSD) service and was dependent on good internet connectivity.

Steps to pay using UPI 123PAY for PNB customers

Step 1-Dial the bank’s easy-to-remember IVR number “9188-123-123”

Step 2-Choose the beneficiary

Step 3-Authenticate the transaction

Further, UPI 123PAY will be multilingual and be available in the customer’s preferred language.

“India’s large population resides in rural and semi-urban areas. Such populations still rely on cash for their daily needs. With approximately 63 per cent of our branches being located in rural and semi-urban areas, PNB has a huge customer base in the remote regions of the nation. To facilitate such people, who do not have access to smartphones or internet connectivity, we are delighted to introduce the functionality of UPI 123PAY. It will enable everyone with any phone to make payments through UPI from anywhere in India. The functionality is also available for non-PNB customers,” said Atul Kumar Goel, MD & CEO of PNB.

UPI payment through pre-defined IVR number

According to NPCI website: UPI payment through pre-defined IVR numbers (080 4516 3666 & 080 4516 3581 & 6366 200 200) would require users to initiate a secured call from their feature phones to a predetermined number and complete UPI on-boarding formalities to be able to start making financial transactions without internet connection. With the IVR providing multiple language options, customers can avail this service in their preferred languages. IDFC First Bank, City Union Bank & NSDL Payments bank have gone live on IVR payments."

319	PFIZER	Pfizer Ltd	Moderna, Pfizer hit with new patent lawsuits over COVID vaccines	"Moderna, Pfizer hit with new patent lawsuits over COVID vaccines

Biotech firm Promosome LLC sued Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, in federal court in San Diego, California, on Tuesday, accusing their COVID-19 vaccines of infringing a patent related to messenger RNA technology.

The lawsuits add to a web of patent disputes between biotech companies over technology used in the coronavirus shots, including a case brought last year in Massachusetts by Moderna against Pfizer and its partner BioNTech.

Promosome accused the companies of copying technology that allows for doses of mRNA that are small enough to use safely and effectively in the vaccines.

Promosome asked the court for a share of royalties from the shots. Pfizer earned $37.8 billion from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty last year, while Moderna made $18.4 billion from its vaccine Spikevax.

Representatives of Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.

Promosome attorney Bill Carmody said in a statement that the vaccine makers have ""failed to give Promosome what it deserves"" for creating groundbreaking technology.

San Diego and New York-based Promosome was formed to commercialize technology developed by biochemistry researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

The vaccines use mRNA to send instructions to the immune system for producing specific proteins to fight the COVID-19 virus. Promosome said its technology enables the immune system to produce sufficient proteins to fight the virus with small doses of mRNA.

The lawsuits said Promosome met with Moderna between 2013 and 2016 to discuss licensing the technology and that Promosome's president demonstrated it to a senior BioNTech scientist in 2015. Promosome said neither company agreed to a license.

Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech in the past have denied infringing other patents."

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

329	PVRINOX	PVR Ltd	Big Picture: Why PVR Inox is expanding fast in the South	"PVR Inox Ltd., on Sunday announced the launch of a new 7-screen multiplex at Global Mall, Mysuru Road in Bengaluru. The 1,189-seater multiplex has increased PVR Inox’s presence in the IT city to 146 screens across 24 properties.

The latest launch is part of the company’s larger strategy to aggressively expand its footprint in South India. In FY23, PVR and Inox added a total of 168 screens, of which, the largest share of 74 screens came in the South, followed by 57 in the North.

Multiplex penetration in the South is the least among all the four regions due to low mall culture, said Jinesh Joshi, Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd. “Also, the southern market is largely dominated by single screens and now that is slowly converting into multiplexes,” he added.

According to estimates, India has about 9,000-10,000 screens, of which roughly about 6,000 are single screens. Joshi said more than 50 per cent of the single screens are located in the South.

Expansion

PVR Inox has estimated 150-175 screen additions in the current fiscal. “A large proportion of our screen expansion will be focused in the South,” Nitin Sood, Group CFO, PVR-INOX Ltd, said in the company’s Q4 earnings call.

“About 40-50 per cent of our overall screen count will continue to be added in southern India over a period of time,” he added.

Under a scheme of amalgamation, PVR Cinemas and Inox Leisure completed their merger this year to create a multiplex behemoth ‘PVR Inox Ltd.’ with over 1,600 screens across the country.

Regional hits

The stellar performance of South Indian movies could be one of the reasons for multiplexes to increase their focus in the region. In the last two years, several regional films from the South, including RRR, KGF Chapter 2, Pushpa, Ponniyin Selvan - 1, 2 and Vikram became pan-Indian blockbusters, garnering thousands of crores in collections while Bollywood films, including Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha, Akshay Kumar’s Samrat Prithviraj and Ranbir Kapoor’s Shamshera failed miserably.

Joshi, however, disagrees that the performance of regional movies can be a criteria for multiplex expansion. “Because content is volatile. Today, regional movies are doing well but a year or two later, it may not do that well; then the expansion can backfire,” he added.

He, however, said the share of regional movies in total box office collections is much higher than pre-Covid levels. Post Covid, hundreds of single screens across the country were forced to shut due to poor footfall and liquidity challenges. Joshi said a lot of single screens are converting into multiplexes and rebranding them with established multiplex players."

336	RELIANCE	Reliance Industries Ltd	IndianOil top bidder for Reliance’s KG gas for second auction in row	"Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation's largest oil firm, has walked away with half of the natural gas that Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp of the UK offered in the latest auction of the fuel used to generate power, produce fertilizer, turned into CNG and used for cooking purposes.

IOC got 2.5 million standard cubic meters per day out of the 5 mmscmd of gas auctioned last month, sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The oil refining and marketing company, which was the top bidder even in the previous auction of gas from the eastern offshore KG-D6 block of Reliance-bp, bid the volumes on behalf of seven fertilizer plants.

City gas companies including GAIL Gas Ltd, Mahanagar Gas Ltd, Torrent Gas, Indian Oil Adani Gas Ltd, and Haryana City Gas secured a total of 0.5 mmscmd of gas for turning into CNG for sale to automobiles and piped to household kitchens for cooking purposes.

State gas utility GAIL and refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) got 0.6 mmscmd each while Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) walked away with 0.5 mmscmd and Shell another 0.2 mmscmd, they said.

Reliance-bp, which two years back reversed the declining trend in domestic gas output by bringing to production their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block lying in deepsea of the Bay of Bengal, are now ramping up supplies.

Natural gas, a cleaner-burning, efficient fuel, is being seen as a transition fuel for nations to move from polluting hydrocarbons to zero-emission fuels.

Reliance-bp in the latest tender offered 5 mmscmd of gas for a period of 3 years starting June 1. Bidders were asked to quote a variable 'v' over and above the JKM price, the spot market benchmark for liquefied natural gas (LNG) delivered to Japan and South Korea.

Sources said the e-auction started on May 19 and ended on May 23 - the longest duration of an auction since the time operators were allowed to sell fuel through open tender.

At the end of the e-auction, gas was sold to 16 buyers at a price of JKM + (plus) USD 0.75 per mmBtu for 3 years, they said adding at the current JKM price of USD 9.2 per mmBtu, the price for KG-D6 gas comes to around USD 10.

This rate compares with the capped price of USD 6.5 per mmBtu that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the state-owned behemoth, gas for fuel produced from legacy or old fields.

Reliance-bp had in April sold 6 mmscmd of gas. IOC had walked away with almost half of the 6 mmscmd of gas sold in an e-auction on April 12 while GAIL bought 0.7 mmscmd, Adani-Total Gas Ltd 0.4 mmscmd, Shell 0.5 mmscmd, GSPC 0.25 mmscmd and IGS another 0.5 mmscmd.

In that auction too, the final bid price came at USD 0.75 per mmBtu premium over the JKM price (JKM + USD 0.75 per mmBtu), sources said.

But the bidders will only have to pay the ceiling or the cap price that the government fixes bi-annually for gas produced from difficult areas, such as deepsea and high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP).

The ceiling price for April to September is USD 12.12 per mmBtu.

Gas produced from wells drilled below the seabed is used to produce electricity, make fertiliser, or turned into CNG for powering automobiles or piped to household kitchens for cooking as well as in industries.

In May last year, Reliance-bp had auctioned 5.5 mmscmd of incremental gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to the same JKM gas marker.

The price discovered in that e-auction came at a USD 0.06 discount to the JKM (Japan-Korea Marker) LNG price.

Prior to that, the duo had sold 7.5 mmscmd of gas at a discount of USD 0.18 per mmBtu to JKM.

Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production in April 2009, and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put into production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing in September 2018, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020.

Since then, Reliance-bp is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deepwater gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ -- which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023."

348	SAIL	Steel Authority of India Ltd	Centre urged to allow takeover of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant by SAIL, says its Independent Director	"June 06, 2023 06:21 pm | Updated 06:21 pm IST - SRIKAKULAM

Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) Independent Director and BJP North-Andhra Campaign Committee convener for the Union government’s achievements in the last nine years, Sagi Kasi Viswanatha Raju has said that he has submitted a proposal to the Centre, requesting the takeover of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) by the SAIL which has already rolled out its expansion plans.

Speaking to The Hindu here on June 6 (Tuesday), he said that the SAIL had planned to increase its capacity from 20 metric tonnes per annum to 50 MTPA by 2023 with an investment of ₹1.8 lakh crore.

“All BJP leaders welcome the Union government’s disinvestment plan of VSP and Nagarnagar Steel Plant in Chhattisgarh. The Centre government has been urged to relax norms and allow the SAIL to take over those plants so that both of them remain as public sector units,” said Mr. Viswanatha Raju.

“It would be a win-win situation for the VSP and the SAIL. The Visakhapatnam Steel Plant has a debt of ₹22,000 crore and it pays up to 14% interest to the lenders. The debt burden will come down as SAIL can get the funding at an interest rate of 4%. Moreover, the SAIL has captive iron mines which can ensure supply of raw material at reasonable prices,” he added.

According to him, a BJP delegation will submit a report to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is scheduled to visit Visakhapatnam on June 11.

The BJP, which is facing criticism over the privatisation of VSP, will get a political upper hand if the steel plant is handed over to another public sector unit such as SAIL. The government has to relax the norms as one PSU is not allowed to take over another PSU, he said."	"“All BJP leaders welcome the Union government’s disinvestment plan of VSP and Nagarnagar Steel Plant in Chhattisgarh.

357	SCHAEFFLER	Schaeffler India Ltd	Bank of Baroda among top 5 stock ideas for next week: Swapnil Shah	Nifty faces an immediate hurdle in the zone of 18,810-18,750 ahead of the all-time pivotal resistance at 18,777. The resistance zone formerly marked exhaustion ahead of the prior declining trend. The current move has been arrested near the resistance zone and formed a bearish harami candle pattern coupled with the RSI on the daily timeframe diverging against the price, and the midcap and smallcaps cooling off after peaking in the overbought zone. This indicates an intermediate top formation. The primary trend remains healthy, however, considering the stupendous rise from the March lows, the index is anticipated to take a breather and garner further bullish strength with crucial support near 18,450 before it resumes its up move towards 19,000 and 19,200.Following the recent run in midcap IT stocks, the overall sector has come under pressure after the US software solutions company, EPAM Systems, announced a reduction in its second quarter and full-year outlook due to further deterioration in the near-term demand environment. With the IT sector embroiled in a storm currently due to the deteriorating global economic outlook, we would advise investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for at least 1-2 quarters before committing to the sector.The weekly price action faced rejection from the previous life high of 44,150 levels in succession. This has resulted in the formation of a long upper wick and the index remains jittery ahead of the US FOMC meeting scheduled in the week to come. Also looking at the options data, we reckon investors to deploy the strategy of bear put spread. The strategy would include buying a lot of 44,100 PE and simultaneously selling 43,500 PE in equal quantity. Based on the strategy, the maximum profit will be bagged on a close below 43,500 levels.From a 12-18 months perspective, we expect the company to do well on the back of multiple company and industry-specific tailwinds. The reduction in Suzlon’s debt, continued traction in its OMS (Operations and Maintenance Services) business and the latest cumulative orders of 1,542 MW which are the highest since 2019 are some of the big positives for the company. We believe that the company’s focus on higher value and higher margin business along with capabilities to execute the same should reflect in the financial performance going forward. Moreover, a strong wind projects bid pipeline of about 10 GW in FY24 and some specific government measures relating to bidding bode well for the company.We anticipate a long opportunity in Bank of Baroda on the back of steady strength in the stock and trend in sectoral price action. The stock has been trading in replica to the sectoral index. The ongoing up-leg comes on the dearth of volumes, volatility at lower levels and tighter compression in price. This further confirms limited supply and less probability of any unruly moves considering the market conditions. We anticipate a potential 10.5% on the upside for the target of Rs 204 and sell stop at Rs 176.The stock has rallied 369% from its all-time low of Rs 37 levels. It underwent an 89-week long gestation period which indicates modest accumulation, fuelling further upside. The prior trend has shown its ability to rise in price and indicates buying interest in the stock. It formed a Darvas box on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 after breaking out which is anticipated as another base of accumulation. It has potentially pierced above the Darvas ceiling and thus the brokerage reckons a buy on the stock. The stock has the potential to run-up to the levels of Rs 187 with support at Rs 161.The price action took a breather as it corrected 35% from the all-time highs after surging 556% from the all-time lows of 605. This limited correction followed by a sideway trend indicates that the potential investors in the stock hold the strength and are keen on further accumulation. This supply suction on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 adds to garnering of further strength and hence the stock is anticipated to offer long opportunities for the target of Rs 3,620. The sell limit can be placed at Rs 2,987.The pattern analysis on the daily timeframe shows that the price action is showing volatility contraction. It has been trading sideways in the last 24 weeks however with elevated swing lows. The swing lows come with time and price correction which indicates professionals’ accumulating available supply whilst the sugar stock trades at a hair’s breadth from the all-time highs. We thus anticipate a potential upside till the levels of Rs 130 with stop loss at Rs 109.The pattern analysis on the weekly chart shows the price action has staged a bullish breakout from the cup and handles schematic on a buoyant volume note. The move in the previous week came on increasing volume trend and improving relative performance compared to Nifty which manifests strength in the trend and validates the breakout further. We, thus, anticipate the price action to continue in the direction of the breakout. The target on the upside comes at Rs 1,700 and stop loss at Rs 1,378.

359	SHARDACROP	Sharda Cropchem Ltd	Technical Analysis: Eicher Motors, Mahindra CIE Automotive, and Sharda Cropchem	"Eicher Motors (₹3,582.1)

Signs of a short-term fall

Eicher Motors’ stock, which took support at ₹2,850 in early April, has been on a rally since then. But after hitting the resistance at ₹3,700 three weeks ago, the stock lost momentum and started moving in a sideways trend. Notably, it declined last week, and the chart shows that the stock has formed an evening star candlestick pattern.

Considering this pattern and that there is a resistance at ₹3,700, the likelihood of a decline from here looks high. The price could possibly drop to ₹3,250. Hence, one can go short on Eicher Motors at the current level of ₹3,582. Add more shorts if the price inches up to ₹3,640. Place stop-loss at ₹3,800 initially. When the price falls below ₹3,400, alter the stop-loss to ₹3,525. Book profits at ₹3,250.

Mahindra CIE Automotive (₹506.6)

Shows good upward momentum

Mahindra CIE Automotive’s share price has been on a long-term uptrend. The latest leg of uptrend began in April at around ₹335. Last week, the stock showed good bullish momentum as it ended the week on a high note. It has closed above the key level of ₹500. Considering the prevailing price action, the likelihood of an extended rally from here is high.

Therefore, we recommend buying the stock of Mahindra CIE Automotive at the current level of about ₹507. Accumulate more shares if the price dips to ₹495. Keep initial stop-loss at ₹475. When the stock rallies to ₹540, exit half of the longs. For the remaining positions, revise the stop-loss up to ₹510. Liquidate the rest at ₹560.

Sharda Cropchem (₹555.8)

Breaches a key level

Sharda Cropchem’s stock has been largely tracing a sideways trend since the beginning of this year. That is, it was oscillating between ₹440 and ₹534. Last week, the stock garnered enough momentum leading to a decisive break out of the barrier at ₹534. This has opened the doors for further rally. Potentially, Sharda Cropchem’s share price can rise to ₹700 in the coming weeks.

Yet, there is a good chance for the stock to soften to ₹534 before the next leg of rally. So, go long now at ₹556 and add more longs if the price corrects to ₹534. Place stop-loss at ₹480 initially. Modify the stop-loss to ₹595 when the stock surpasses ₹625. Further, when the stock rallies past ₹660, tighten the stop-loss to ₹630. Exit at ₹690."

361	SBILIFE	SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd	Macquarie downgrades 3 private sector insurers on growth concerns	"

“We now forecast a lower value of new business (VNB) CAGR (compound annual growth rate) at 9-15 per cent for FY23-26E (financial years 2022-23 to estimates for 2025-2026) versus 16-22 per cent for FY22-25E. The near term catalysts are missing. Unless growth picks up meaningfully, sector performance will lag. Valuation support implies limited downside,” said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie Capital in a note. Brokerage firm Macquarie has downgraded the ratings of three leading private sector insurers HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life from ‘outperform’ to ‘neutral’, citing growth concerns. The brokerage house has also lowered the price targets for all three by more than 15 per cent each.



“The VNB CAGR over the past five years (FY18-23) for the private sector has been 17-30 per cent, largely driven by record level of margins, closer to 30 per cent for most large players versus sub 20 per cent five years ago. We believe margins have more or less peaked, and we don't expect it to support VNB growth this cycle. Additionally, with recent tax changes, there should be an impact on growth,” he added. Shares of all three companies ended on a soft note on Friday with ICICI Pru Life declining the most by 3.5 per cent to end the day at Rs 495 apiece.



In the past one year, insurance stocks have underperformed the benchmark Nifty50 by close to 13 per cent. As a result, the valuations of companies in this sector are one or two standard deviations below historical averages. However, for valuations to look compelling at these levels, Macquarie believes the growth in VBN has to be over 20 per cent. This year’s Union Budget 2023-24 has limited the income tax exemption on the proceeds of high value life insurance policies. Under this, only income from life insurance policies with an aggregate premium of up to Rs 5 lakh will be exempt from taxation.

At present, HDFC Life trades at 15.3x its projected VNB for FY25, while ICICI Pru and SBI Life trade at 8.1 times and 9.5 times, respectively. “We believe that the markets won't be enthusiastic about a sub-optimal 9-15 per cent VNB growth this cycle. Consequently, multiples could remain depressed. We think growth is the single biggest catalyst for the sector. April 2023 numbers have been weak, but we won't read too much into one month's numbers,” Ganapathy has said.

Macquarie says HDFC Life historically has “shown exceptional ability to manage impact of regulatory changes and government policy changes on tax etc. through product innovation and enhancing distribution capabilities.”

“Hence, in our model we continue to forecast an above industry Rs 15 per cent VNB CAGR for them over the next three years. For the overall private sector life insurance industry overall VNB CAGR could be sub 10 per cent in our view in this cycle.”

The brokerage firm also revised its value of new business (VBN) estimates by 2-6 percent for FY25. Macquarie has forecast a lower compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for VNB in the range of 9-15 percent for FY23-26, compared to the previous projection of 16-22 percent for FY22-25.

Macquarie says insurance companies and the overall sector lack near-term catalysts and, unless there is a significant and meaningful increase in growth, the performance of insurance companies is expected to lag.

Insurance stocks came under pressure after the government in the budget proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. The Centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards.

These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies, analysts said."

364	SIEMENS	Siemens Ltd	ABB India shares at Rs 5,000? UBS upgrades stock to ‘Buy’. Here’s why	"Foreign brokerage UBS has upgraded ABB India shares to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' earlier, with a revised target of Rs 5,000 against Rs 3,770, suggesting a 21 per cent upside over June 9's closing value of Rs 4,148.90. Short-cycle demand for ABB's industrial products has been stronger than expected on the back of its deeper geographical penetration, UBS said.

Electrification and motion are set to lift margins even though ABB remains dependent on imports in process automation and robotics, it said adding that ABB India's Indian leadership is highly focused on expanding market opportunities, especially in low voltage electrification.

""While consensus margin forecasts have risen 120 bps in the past 12 months, we think ABB's true potential from value-accretive electrification and motion has yet to be priced in. A growing contribution from highly scalable new segments and products aid growth and OPM, supported by active capex,"" it said.

UBS said it remains bullish on industrial automation and low voltage electrification demand and sees an improving case for further operating profit margin growth.

""We lift margins by 130 bps and earnings by 10-17 per cent for CY23-25E, which we believe realistically reflects the sustainability of margins, driven by volume and revenue mix benefits from electrification and motion. Our CY24/25E earnings forecasts are 10 per cent/15 per cent ahead of consensus. We raise our price target from Rs 3,770 to Rs5,000, and upgrade the stock to Buy, based on a peak PE of 70 times (vs the 62 times earlier), pricing in the potential for greater growth-led capex,"" it said.

UBS' order of preferences in the industrial sector coverage is now Siemens, ABB India, Larsen & Toubro and BHEL.

With wide innovation-driven moats and high value-added products, ABB is extending its geographical reach in its leadership segments, such as motors, drives, low and medium voltage switches, and switchgears, which in UBS said have a lot more room to grow profitably.

Further momentum in service-layered long-term projects points to medium-to long-term growth in revenue share from high margin services, it said.

366	SOBHA	Sobha Ltd	Sobha to construct 1,000 houses as part of community home project	"Real estate player Sobha has chalked out plans to construct 1,000 houses for BPL families in Palakkad over the next four years, as part of its community home project.

Of this, 100 houses – each costing ₹15 lakh – are being constructed in the first phase under the aegis of its philanthropic wing Sri Kurumba Educational & Charitable Trust, said P.N.C. Menon, Founder, Sobha Group.

Sobha’s community home project is a unique social development initiative that was conceived to build homes for the less fortunate families in Palakkad, he added.

The Trust started a massive project in 2023 to build houses for the most economically disadvantaged families in Kizhakkenchery Panchayat in Palakkad. The scheme will be implemented in different phases with the most deserving homeless 100 women-headed families getting houses in 2023-24, he said.

According to him, the company has spent ₹2,269 million on various welfare projects including education of girls, healthcare, looking after the aged and the needy, women empowerment, and green initiatives with over 17,000 direct beneficiaries.

Positive outlook

Apart from footprint expansion in Kerala- a State that contributes approximately 10 per cent of all-India sales of the company- Sobha has plans to move pan-India to cater to the housing needs of the premium demographic segment.

Sobha achieved its highest annual sales of ₹51.98 billion, 5.65 million sq ft with an average price realisation of ₹9,200 sq ft in the country in FY23. “We launched nine residential projects with total saleable area of 3.96 million sq ft and started operations in two new cities – Thiruvananthapuram and Hyderabad in FY23”, Menon said

The Indian real estate sector is forecasted to grow to $1 trillion by 2030 from $200 billion in 2021. The residential real estate market has made rapid progress in 2022, setting new sales records of 68 per cent y-o-y.

Unlike the major global property markets that saw a downturn due to high mortgage rates, un-affordability and the return of Covid, he said India showed resilience and recovered from the decade-old down cycle."

Shares of EKI Energy Services Ltd (EKIESL) gained over 4 percent on June 6 on the back of higher volume. At 9.49am, the stock was trading at Rs 428 on BSE, up 4.35 percent from its previous close. EKI Energy recently made an announcement to the stock exchanges regarding the establishment of a wholly owned subsidiary named EKI Community Development Foundation.

Key goals

The primary objective of this subsidiary is to promote, facilitate, develop, and implement programmes that offer sustainable solutions to address emerging environmental needs. The foundation will focus on working in the areas of climate change and global warming, with the aim of reducing their impact.

One of the key goals of the subsidiary is to contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases. This will be achieved through the establishment of projects, allocation of resources, and implementing various measures to procure natural resources in a sustainable manner. The foundation will also emphasise the acquisition of renewable natural resources and actively engage in initiatives to protect and preserve the environment.

Recently, the firm's stock saw a drastic fall after its auditor raised concerns on the company's financial statements. The auditor, Walker Chandiok & Co LLP, in its report stated that there were ""material weaknesses"" in the company's internal financial controls, and raised concerns about the accuracy and completeness of its financial statements.

The stock hit a 52 week high of Rs 2964 on June 7, 2022 and since then it has lost over 86 percent. The firm is yet to report its March quarter earnings.

According to the report, EKI Energy had incorrectly classified certain expenses as assets, which had the effect of overstating the company's profits.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

Jefferies India has cut its target price on Sunteck Realty Ltd to Rs 415 a share from Rs 621 a share amid weak earnings. The brokerage house, however, maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock.

Sunteck, a real estate company, faced a challenging year with weak financial performance. In the fourth quarter (Q4), it reported a loss of Rs 30 crore, contributing to an overall disappointing year. Despite this, the company managed to achieve a small net profit of Rs 10 crore for the fiscal year 2023 (FY23).

The company experienced a significant 29 percent decline in revenues to Rs 360 crore during FY23, primary because of sluggish offtake in its completed projects in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) area, along with the absence of any other major project completions. As a strategic decision, Sunteck opted to lease out their commercial projects in BKC instead of pursuing sales, as they observed a strong yield of over 20 percent on their cost.

""Weak performance of the BKC projects (Rs 0.8 billion sold versus Rs 15 billion inventory) in FY23 and some launch delays drive cuts to our FY24/25 revenue estimates by 13 percent/26 percent and earnings by 47 percent/34 percent. Pre-sales for FY24/25 are changed to a lesser extent i.e. 11 percent/2 percent. Though some listed companies have demonstrated much faster sales growth as the housing cycle strengthened over the past 2 years; we find Sunteck to be on a steady 20-25 percent pre-sales growth path,"" Jefferies India said in a note to investors.

Recently, Sunteck reported a boost in pre-sales during the fourth quarter (4Q) due to the successful launch of their new project in Mira Road. They achieved a 12-quarter high pre-sales figure of Rs 540 crore, up 7 percent year-on-year (YoY). Looking at the overall fiscal year 2023 (FY23), pre-sales showed a significant 23 percent on-year growth to Rs 1,600 crore which was fell short of the management's initial guidance of Rs 1,800 crore provided at the beginning of the year. The management attributed this shortfall to delays in project launches, such as Mira Road towards the end of the year, and the postponement of the Kalyan project to the second half of FY24.

""We assume development company pre-sales to record a 20 percent+ CAGR over FY22-25. The housing market is expected to be an upcycle, particularly in the home market of Mumbai. Cap rate at 8.5 percent, discount rate at 12 percent,"" the Jefferies report added.

In an upside scenario, Jefferies see's its target price at Rs 600 a share, up 112 percent from current market price. ""Higher-than-expected sales growth, price appreciation and / or new project additions could drive upside surprises and the stock could see significant NAV upgrades. Lower interest rates could also be a trigger,"" it said."

376	SRF	SRF Ltd	SRF, GFCL, Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine: How have they fared and which stock to buy?	"The past years have been transformational for speciality chemicals players, and the narrative in Q4FY23 results points to continued growth in some areas, while challenges are emerging in a few areas. Capex plans continue to be on the higher side, supported by past capex bearing results. New product lines and categories are being added across companies, but some existing lines may face volatility in the short term. We have analyzed the fourth quarter results of the five largest companies in the sector for a consolidated view.

Demand for value-added products

The big five – SRF, Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFCL), Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine – in order of market capitalization, have reported divergent revenue growth ranging from 5 to 70 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter. In SRF and Deepak Nitrite, which reported lower revenue growth, the main segments (speciality chemicals and phenols, respectively) continue to deliver double-digit growth with weakness in other segments, resulting in 5-6 per cent YoY growth on a consolidated basis.

Value-added products, including refrigerant gases, contractual products and downstream applications, reported strong demand visibility. Refrigerant gases gained from shortage-related price hikes in the past. But as developed markets phase out production and consumption, global demand for the same from Indian manufacturers should sustain. Companies offering contractual development (CDMO) – SRF and Navin, reported operationalising client/product-specific plants with visibility of continued additions into the future. Flourine-related chemistries spanning SRF, Navin and GFCL continue to have strong demand visibility.

On the contrary, industry-specific, commoditised product lines – textiles, packaging for SRF, dyes/pigments for Deepak Nitrite, consumer discretionary for Atul and Aarti or even generic agrochemical/pharma intermediaries manufacturers, reported a weak demand environment. High-interest rates, channel stocking or inventory rationalisation could be seen as a reason. While volume growth may be positive, pricing may remain weak through FY24. This should moderate consolidated margins in the short term from earlier higher levels.

Capex remains secularly high

Speciality chemicals, a capex-driven narrative, continue to be in a high investment mode. GFCL has added fluoropolymer lines and expects a significant contribution from FY25. The company is investing ₹1,000 - ₹1,500 crore per fiscal in FY22-24, and the capex will be focused on fluoropolymers. SRF will be operationalising its first line of fluoropolymers in H2FY24 and is eyeing products further down the line. New dedicated lines for advanced intermediaries in agrochem and pharma will be added along with new-age products for SRF. Navin expects a higher run rate of existing CDMO plants and expects to add furthermore. All three companies will add higher capacity for refrigerant gases, potentially leading to overinvestment in the space if the volume growth does not pan out (companies are confident of demand strength, though).

Deepak Nitrites is also eyeing capex of ₹2,500 crore over the next three years, which should improve its phenols business-related downstream applications and backward integration. Similarly, Tata Chemicals which also operates at the base chemicals level, plans on ₹2,000 crore capex for the next three years, which should improve soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and silica capacities. Similar to complex fluoropolymers of other companies, Tata Chemicals base products are also eyeing a multifold growth in solar, electric vehicle, fuel cells and other new age applications for growth in demand. On the other hand, capex plans of companies reliant on commoditised products, which are facing a short-term slowdown in demand, may face lower returns from invested capital if the slowdown extends beyond the short term.

The valuation range of the sector is wide, starting from 23 to 46 times FY24 earnings (excluding Tata Chemicals, which trades at ten times owing to its basic chemicals nature). The higher-than-market range (18-20 times FY24 earnings for Nifty) is owing to the capex mode the companies are in. We recently recommended investors accumulate SRF. Earlier, we also recommended investors buy GFCL stock when trading at₹2,770. The stocks are trading at reasonable multiples given growth prospects (23 times for GFCL and 30 times for SRF), operate at the upper end of the value chain, and invest in the right areas (away from consumer discretionary space facing lower demand). But one must constantly monitor the ‘new demand’ from Europe, import replacement, and new clients/products to justify the valuation range."

380	TATAPOWER	Tata Power Company Ltd	Power plants using imported coal to operate at full capacity till September	"

Many power plants in India, including those owned by Adani Power and Tata Power use imported coal, but were not operating at full capacity, adding to challenges for the country in meeting its power demand amid an ongoing heat wave.

India on Monday said power plants operating on imported coal would have to run at full capacity till the end of September, extending an earlier timeline by over three months, according to a government order seen by Reuters.



India initially said in February these plants were to operate at full capacity till June 15, as the government looked to maximise output ahead of an expected record surge in power usage during the summer.

Various places in India have been reeling under severe heat over the last few weeks, with maximum temperatures hitting 42-44 degrees Celsius over parts of Central, Northwest, East, and North India on Saturday.



The order has been sent to JSW Ratnagiri Ltd., Essar Power Gujarat Ltd and 13 other factories totalling a capacity of 17 gigawatts.

""It has now been decided to extend the time period for... directive to imported coal-based generators, up to September 30,"" the order issued by the Ministry of Power on Monday states.

He would rather avoid publicity and the media. Business tycoon Ratan Tata never married. But he remained very close to his siblings, especially his younger brother Jimmy Naval Tata. In order to wish his brother Jimmy a happy birthday, Ratan Tata shared a black-and-white photo of himself with him and their dog a few months ago. In his words, ""nothing came between"" the two brothers. As a result, internet users became more curious and began learning more about Jimmy Naval Tata.

Billionaire Ratan Tata, one of India's most popular and favorite businessmen, has more than 7 million Instagram followers. He has established a solid reputation as a people person because of his modest outlook on both life and business. Ratan Tata claims that the photograph was taken in 1945. Tata posted this image to Instagram and commented that their childhood was blissful because nothing could separate the two brothers. At the time this story was being written, Tata's most recent Instagram post had received more than 10 Lakh likes in two hours since it was posted. Users praised Tata for having such a remarkable recollection after the look into his history appeared on his Instagram.

Former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata is a proponent of leading a simple life. Jimmy Naval Tata was successful running the family business, but he made the decision to slow down and live a simple life. Jimmy Tata, despite his enormous riches, resides in a two-bedroom flat in Mumbai's Colaba area. He reportedly doesn't even have a phone, yet he still reads books and newspapers. Billionaire and philanthropist Harsh Goenka last year made a post in which he referenced Jimmy Tata's modest flat and lack of involvement in the family business. Not only that, but he also claimed Jimmy Tata, a superb squash player, used to consistently defeat him (Harsh Goenka).

Tata Elxsi shares gained over 2 percent on June 8 as investors cheered the company's partnership with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to enable the upcoming Gaganyaan Mission.

Through the association, Tata Elxsi has designed and developed Crew Module Recovery Models (CMRM) for recovery team training of the space mission, the company said.

At 10.30 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 7,866.55 on the NSE, higher by 2.26 percent from the previous close.

In the Gaganyaan project, scheduled for 2024, the crew will be launched into a 400-kilometer orbit for a three-day mission.

""One of the key requirements of this project is the safe recovery of the crew, which must be carried out with minimum lapse of time. This is where the crew recovery models come into use,"" the company said.

On June 7, the company also announced the launch of an innovation hub and nearshore engineering centre in Troy, Michigan. The new centre will support electric vehicles and green mobility, software and digital engineering for OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers.

""Tata Elxsi intends to grow its centre from 50 to 200 by 2025 while collaborating with universities on cutting-edge R&D,"" a press release said.

He would rather avoid publicity and the media. Business tycoon Ratan Tata never married. But he remained very close to his siblings, especially his younger brother Jimmy Naval Tata. In order to wish his brother Jimmy a happy birthday, Ratan Tata shared a black-and-white photo of himself with him and their dog a few months ago. In his words, ""nothing came between"" the two brothers. As a result, internet users became more curious and began learning more about Jimmy Naval Tata.

Billionaire Ratan Tata, one of India's most popular and favorite businessmen, has more than 7 million Instagram followers. He has established a solid reputation as a people person because of his modest outlook on both life and business. Ratan Tata claims that the photograph was taken in 1945. Tata posted this image to Instagram and commented that their childhood was blissful because nothing could separate the two brothers. At the time this story was being written, Tata's most recent Instagram post had received more than 10 Lakh likes in two hours since it was posted. Users praised Tata for having such a remarkable recollection after the look into his history appeared on his Instagram.

Former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata is a proponent of leading a simple life. Jimmy Naval Tata was successful running the family business, but he made the decision to slow down and live a simple life. Jimmy Tata, despite his enormous riches, resides in a two-bedroom flat in Mumbai's Colaba area. He reportedly doesn't even have a phone, yet he still reads books and newspapers. Billionaire and philanthropist Harsh Goenka last year made a post in which he referenced Jimmy Tata's modest flat and lack of involvement in the family business. Not only that, but he also claimed Jimmy Tata, a superb squash player, used to consistently defeat him (Harsh Goenka).

386	TATACHEM	Tata Chemicals Ltd	Tata Chemicals to Turn 175% Ex-Dividend This Week, InvestingPro Sees Upside			1 day ago
386	TATACHEM	Tata Chemicals Ltd	SRF, GFCL, Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine: How have they fared and which stock to buy?	"The past years have been transformational for speciality chemicals players, and the narrative in Q4FY23 results points to continued growth in some areas, while challenges are emerging in a few areas. Capex plans continue to be on the higher side, supported by past capex bearing results. New product lines and categories are being added across companies, but some existing lines may face volatility in the short term. We have analyzed the fourth quarter results of the five largest companies in the sector for a consolidated view.

Demand for value-added products

The big five – SRF, Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFCL), Deepak Nitrite, Tata Chemicals and Navin Fluorine – in order of market capitalization, have reported divergent revenue growth ranging from 5 to 70 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter. In SRF and Deepak Nitrite, which reported lower revenue growth, the main segments (speciality chemicals and phenols, respectively) continue to deliver double-digit growth with weakness in other segments, resulting in 5-6 per cent YoY growth on a consolidated basis.

Value-added products, including refrigerant gases, contractual products and downstream applications, reported strong demand visibility. Refrigerant gases gained from shortage-related price hikes in the past. But as developed markets phase out production and consumption, global demand for the same from Indian manufacturers should sustain. Companies offering contractual development (CDMO) – SRF and Navin, reported operationalising client/product-specific plants with visibility of continued additions into the future. Flourine-related chemistries spanning SRF, Navin and GFCL continue to have strong demand visibility.

On the contrary, industry-specific, commoditised product lines – textiles, packaging for SRF, dyes/pigments for Deepak Nitrite, consumer discretionary for Atul and Aarti or even generic agrochemical/pharma intermediaries manufacturers, reported a weak demand environment. High-interest rates, channel stocking or inventory rationalisation could be seen as a reason. While volume growth may be positive, pricing may remain weak through FY24. This should moderate consolidated margins in the short term from earlier higher levels.

Capex remains secularly high

Speciality chemicals, a capex-driven narrative, continue to be in a high investment mode. GFCL has added fluoropolymer lines and expects a significant contribution from FY25. The company is investing ₹1,000 - ₹1,500 crore per fiscal in FY22-24, and the capex will be focused on fluoropolymers. SRF will be operationalising its first line of fluoropolymers in H2FY24 and is eyeing products further down the line. New dedicated lines for advanced intermediaries in agrochem and pharma will be added along with new-age products for SRF. Navin expects a higher run rate of existing CDMO plants and expects to add furthermore. All three companies will add higher capacity for refrigerant gases, potentially leading to overinvestment in the space if the volume growth does not pan out (companies are confident of demand strength, though).

Deepak Nitrites is also eyeing capex of ₹2,500 crore over the next three years, which should improve its phenols business-related downstream applications and backward integration. Similarly, Tata Chemicals which also operates at the base chemicals level, plans on ₹2,000 crore capex for the next three years, which should improve soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and silica capacities. Similar to complex fluoropolymers of other companies, Tata Chemicals base products are also eyeing a multifold growth in solar, electric vehicle, fuel cells and other new age applications for growth in demand. On the other hand, capex plans of companies reliant on commoditised products, which are facing a short-term slowdown in demand, may face lower returns from invested capital if the slowdown extends beyond the short term.

The valuation range of the sector is wide, starting from 23 to 46 times FY24 earnings (excluding Tata Chemicals, which trades at ten times owing to its basic chemicals nature). The higher-than-market range (18-20 times FY24 earnings for Nifty) is owing to the capex mode the companies are in. We recently recommended investors accumulate SRF. Earlier, we also recommended investors buy GFCL stock when trading at₹2,770. The stocks are trading at reasonable multiples given growth prospects (23 times for GFCL and 30 times for SRF), operate at the upper end of the value chain, and invest in the right areas (away from consumer discretionary space facing lower demand). But one must constantly monitor the ‘new demand’ from Europe, import replacement, and new clients/products to justify the valuation range."

387	SUZLON	Suzlon Energy Ltd	Suzlon Energy shares hit fresh 52-week high, up 86% in a month; here’s what analysts say	"Suzlon Energy shares on Monday extended their gains for the second consecutive session. The stock today jumped 9.92 per cent to hit its 52-week high of Rs 15.40. It eventually settled 9.14 per cent higher at Rs 15.29. The scrip has gained 85.56 per cent in the past one month.

In an earnings call, Himanshu Mody, Group CFO of Suzlon Energy, said, ""For FY24 (2023-24), I can confirm that at the consolidated level, there will be no tax outgo because we would be utilising our carry forward losses. And the total carry forward losses -- on the balance sheet as of today is exceeding Rs 2,000 crore.""

""Compared between FY22 to FY23, the interest cost reduction (was) about 44 per cent. It certainly won't be to that extent (this year) because there may be working capital facilities, which are by way of non-fund-based limits, which we will be ramping up for the execution of these orders,"" Mody further stated.

Bourses BSE and NSE have put the securities of Suzlon Energy under the short-term ASM (Additional Surveillance Measure) framework. The parameters for shortlisting securities under ASM include high-low variation, client concentration, number of price band hits, close-to-close price variation and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Exchanges put stocks in short-term or long-term ASM frameworks to caution investors about high volatility in share prices.

Prior to this, Suzlon Group announced that it has crossed the 20GW wind energy installations milestone through 12,467 wind turbines installed across 17 countries spanning six continents. According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India currently has a total renewable energy capacity of 168.96 GW (as of February 28, 2023) with about 82GW at various stages of implementation and about 41GW under tendering stage. This includes 64.38GW solar power, 51.79GW hydropower, 42.02GW wind power and 10.77GW biopower.

Suzlon Energy reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 320 crore for the March 2023 quarter, led by lower expenses. It recorded a consolidated net loss of Rs 193 crore in Q4 FY22. In addition, Suzlon reduced its net debt by 79.64 per cent to Rs 1,180 crore in Q4 FY23 compared to Rs 5,796 crore in the corresponding period last year.

On technical setup, support on the counter could be seen at Rs 13.50.

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""Suzlon is bullish but also overbought on the daily charts with the next resistance at Rs 16.80. A daily close below support of Rs 13.50 could lead to a target of Rs 11.30 in the near term.""

Vaishali Parekh, Vice-President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, ""The stock has witnessed a decent rise in the past 2-3 weeks gathering momentum with huge volume participation. One can keep the stop loss near Rs 12.40 levels, below which again the bias can weaken and further slide could be expected. As of now, the overall trend is maintained positive as long as Rs 12.40 levels are sustained.""

Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One, said, ""Suzlon has witnessed a strong spurt in the last couple of trading weeks. With the recent price movement, the stock has witnessed a strong breakout around Rs 11-odd zone. Till the stock sustains above the breakout zone, it is highly anticipated to continue its upsurge with immediate resistance placed around the Rs 16-odd zone in the comparable period.""

Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks traded higher today, led by gains in technology, metals, state-owned lenders and energy stocks.

Nifty outlook

""Rejection trades evolved precisely from 18,676, as feared, but luckily the dips below 18,595 did not lead to a collapse as such. This encourages us to play for a pullback, should we see Nifty floating above 18,595 early in the day. Directional trades will have to wait for 18,720 to be cleared through. Alternatively, in the event of 18,500 giving away, 18,430 will hold only a slim chance of holding with 18,200 emerging as the first downside target, while also raising the vulnerability of the 50-DMA now positioned at 18,047,"" said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services."

387	SUZLON	Suzlon Energy Ltd	Should you buy, sell or hold Suzlon Energy? Anand James shares his tech view	NEW DELHI: Given the steep rally seen in the shares of Suzlon Energy and the oversold condition of oscillators, trades should book profits in the counter, says Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services “But we feel that the two days’ consolidation suggest the formation of a continuation pattern, which augurs well for the sustainability of the uptrend with eyes on Rs 18-20 initially as it comes off a cup and handle pattern. Key support level is seen near Rs 12 which may be used as a downside marker,” he says. Edited excerpts from a chat:The swing lower from oversold levels is similar to the one seen in late May, except for two facts: Firstly, this time, the turn is from a higher level, and closer to record peak. Secondly MACD histogram has registered a sizable dip below zero line. While these two factors prevented Nifty from staging a recovery as swift as what evolved post late May’s fall, favoured view sees a fair possibility of a regrouping first without stretching much beyond 18500. However the prospects of getting back onto the 18888-19070 trajectory is not clear, with 18600 and 18720 posing as key obstacles. Meanwhile, in the event of 18500 giving away, 18430 will hold only a slim chance of holding with 18200 emerging as the first downside target, while also raising the vulnerability of the 50DMA now positioned at 18047.Selling pressure was spread across Large and Midcap IT stocks with an average decline of 3-4%. However, smallcap IT stocks found momentum. We could see some more profit booking in Midcap IT stocks in the coming week before bulls regroup. Smallcaps could outperform. Meanwhile, the tech heavy Nasdaq is above one year peak, and its progress will also be watched, given Indian IT stocks’ correlation with Nasdaq, especially as FOMC rate decision looms.While Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank tried to buck the trend, heavy weights in Bank Nifty fell this week. Meanwhile, HDFC Bank ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank , which form ~60% of BankNifty, have shown early signs of reversal. Furthermore, Axisbank and Indusindbnk have not shown signs of giving up even after this week’s gains. All this is pointing towards the assumption that we might be gearing up for a pullback in BankNifty next week, and traders may attempt a bull put spread to capitalise on the recent rise in put premia.The stock warrants profit booking in the near term especially given the steepness of the rise and the oversold condition of oscillators. But we feel that the two days’ consolidation suggest the formation of a continuation pattern, which augurs well for the sustainability of the uptrend with eyes on Rs 18-20 initially as it comes off a cup and handle pattern. Key support level is seen near Rs 12 which may be used as downside marker.View: BuyEntry range: 203 – 198Target: 208 - 215Stoploss: 194The stock had broken out of the rounding pattern in the monthly time frame and the initial consolidation had honored the pattern breakout resistance of 186. Also it has taken support at the rising trendline support of 200 in the daily time frame with MACD showing signs of bullish exhaustion. We expect buying interest to emerge in the 198-203 region which could push the stock towards 208-215 levels in the next three months. All longs may be protected with stoploss placed below 194 levels.View: BuyEntry range: 236 - 228Target: 248 - 260Stoploss: 219The stock has been moving within a triangle pattern in monthly charts since 2015 and has now bounced off the lower trend line support of the pattern hinting positive days ahead. Also, the momentum indicator MACD is about to cross the signal line supporting our assumption. We expect the stock to move towards 248 and thereafter towards 260 in the next three to six months. All longs may be protected with stoploss placed below 219.	"Key support level is seen near Rs 12 which may be used as a downside marker,” he says.

388	TATACOMM	Tata Communications Ltd	Bank of Baroda among top 5 stock ideas for next week: Swapnil Shah	Nifty faces an immediate hurdle in the zone of 18,810-18,750 ahead of the all-time pivotal resistance at 18,777. The resistance zone formerly marked exhaustion ahead of the prior declining trend. The current move has been arrested near the resistance zone and formed a bearish harami candle pattern coupled with the RSI on the daily timeframe diverging against the price, and the midcap and smallcaps cooling off after peaking in the overbought zone. This indicates an intermediate top formation. The primary trend remains healthy, however, considering the stupendous rise from the March lows, the index is anticipated to take a breather and garner further bullish strength with crucial support near 18,450 before it resumes its up move towards 19,000 and 19,200.Following the recent run in midcap IT stocks, the overall sector has come under pressure after the US software solutions company, EPAM Systems, announced a reduction in its second quarter and full-year outlook due to further deterioration in the near-term demand environment. With the IT sector embroiled in a storm currently due to the deteriorating global economic outlook, we would advise investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for at least 1-2 quarters before committing to the sector.The weekly price action faced rejection from the previous life high of 44,150 levels in succession. This has resulted in the formation of a long upper wick and the index remains jittery ahead of the US FOMC meeting scheduled in the week to come. Also looking at the options data, we reckon investors to deploy the strategy of bear put spread. The strategy would include buying a lot of 44,100 PE and simultaneously selling 43,500 PE in equal quantity. Based on the strategy, the maximum profit will be bagged on a close below 43,500 levels.From a 12-18 months perspective, we expect the company to do well on the back of multiple company and industry-specific tailwinds. The reduction in Suzlon’s debt, continued traction in its OMS (Operations and Maintenance Services) business and the latest cumulative orders of 1,542 MW which are the highest since 2019 are some of the big positives for the company. We believe that the company’s focus on higher value and higher margin business along with capabilities to execute the same should reflect in the financial performance going forward. Moreover, a strong wind projects bid pipeline of about 10 GW in FY24 and some specific government measures relating to bidding bode well for the company.We anticipate a long opportunity in Bank of Baroda on the back of steady strength in the stock and trend in sectoral price action. The stock has been trading in replica to the sectoral index. The ongoing up-leg comes on the dearth of volumes, volatility at lower levels and tighter compression in price. This further confirms limited supply and less probability of any unruly moves considering the market conditions. We anticipate a potential 10.5% on the upside for the target of Rs 204 and sell stop at Rs 176.The stock has rallied 369% from its all-time low of Rs 37 levels. It underwent an 89-week long gestation period which indicates modest accumulation, fuelling further upside. The prior trend has shown its ability to rise in price and indicates buying interest in the stock. It formed a Darvas box on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 after breaking out which is anticipated as another base of accumulation. It has potentially pierced above the Darvas ceiling and thus the brokerage reckons a buy on the stock. The stock has the potential to run-up to the levels of Rs 187 with support at Rs 161.The price action took a breather as it corrected 35% from the all-time highs after surging 556% from the all-time lows of 605. This limited correction followed by a sideway trend indicates that the potential investors in the stock hold the strength and are keen on further accumulation. This supply suction on improving relative performance compared to Nifty50 adds to garnering of further strength and hence the stock is anticipated to offer long opportunities for the target of Rs 3,620. The sell limit can be placed at Rs 2,987.The pattern analysis on the daily timeframe shows that the price action is showing volatility contraction. It has been trading sideways in the last 24 weeks however with elevated swing lows. The swing lows come with time and price correction which indicates professionals’ accumulating available supply whilst the sugar stock trades at a hair’s breadth from the all-time highs. We thus anticipate a potential upside till the levels of Rs 130 with stop loss at Rs 109.The pattern analysis on the weekly chart shows the price action has staged a bullish breakout from the cup and handles schematic on a buoyant volume note. The move in the previous week came on increasing volume trend and improving relative performance compared to Nifty which manifests strength in the trend and validates the breakout further. We, thus, anticipate the price action to continue in the direction of the breakout. The target on the upside comes at Rs 1,700 and stop loss at Rs 1,378.

388	TATACOMM	Tata Communications Ltd	Trade setup for today: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The market has seen a correction for the first time in the last five consecutive sessions on June 8, after the RBI Monetary Policy Committee unanimously held the repo rate at 6.5 percent, in line with consensus expectations while retaining the withdrawal of accommodation stance by five out of six votes. Most of the sectors, barring metal, saw correction.

The BSE Sensex fell 294 points to 62,849, while the Nifty50 declined 92 points to 18,635 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, which experts feel is the short-term reversal of the trend.

""A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with an upper shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates rejection of bulls at the highs and this could be considered as a short-term reversal pattern on the downside,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He feels Thursday's swing high could be considered as a new higher top of the sequence and further weakness for the short term is expected to be a higher bottom of the sequence.

At the lows, Nifty could find cluster support like ascending trendline, 10-day and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) around 18,560-18,450 levels, he said.

The broader markets also snapped rallies of several sessions as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 0.55 percent and 0.95 percent, respectively.

A breach below this support level might indicate a further downside potential and could attract additional selling interest from traders and investors,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

As per the pivot point calculator, the Bank Nifty is expected to take support at 43,917, followed by 43,790 and 43,583, while the resistance is likely to be at 44,331, then 44,459 and 44,665.

388	TATACOMM	Tata Communications Ltd	Tata Communications shares upbeat outlook; stock price targets suggest most positives priced in	"Tata group firm Tata Communications shared an upbeat outlook at its investor meet -- giving a 2x revenue guidance by FY27, following which a host of brokerages upped their share price target on the stock. That said even revised targets by a few brokerages suggest a potential downside on the stock, as brokerages felt a 44 per cent upside on the counter in 2023 so far captures in most positives.

Kotak Institutional Equities raised its target to Rs 1,350 from Rs 1,300, but it sees limited upside potential post the recent run up. Motilal Oswal Securities also finds the stock Rs 1,350 worthy. A sustained improvement in earnings growth visibility will be vital for valuation rerating, it said. On Thursday, the scrip was trading 0.67 per cent higher at Rs 1,436 on BSE. ICICI Securities, however, increased its target price to Rs 1,665 on Tata Communications from Rs 1,510 earlier, as it raised its FY25E PE multiple to 22 times from 20 times.

Tata Communications expects data revenue to double by FY27 to Rs 28,000 crore, up 18 per cent compounded annually. This, it feels, will be driven by over 35 per cent annual growth in its digital services revenue, with the product mix rising over 50 per cent.

This, analysts said, is a significant acceleration in digital services revenue growth against 19 per cent in the past three years, and data revenue growth which was under 10 per cent.

Tata Communications expects international revenue to grow faster where it has good lead indicators. Despite the rise in low margin digital services, company anticipates Ebitda margin to be stable at 23-25 per cent, with RoCE of over 25 per cent.

""We believe acceleration in revenue may start showing in the next 12-18 months as the company reaps benefits of the rise in execution of order wins, and international business starts firing. We are yet to factor The Switch acquisition in our estimates, and our data revenue growth forecast is conservative at 12 per cent over FY23-25E,"" ICICI Securities said.

Motilal Oswal Securities said it has factored in revenue CAGR of 12 per cent and Ebitda CAGR of 10 per cent over FY23-25. The management has

reiterated improved funnel of new deal, but Motilal Oswal said its translation into meaningful growth will be key for Tata Communications to achieve double-digit earnings growth.

""The silver lining is its strong FCF of Rs 1,400-2,300 crore despite increase in capex implying FCF yield in the mid-single digits and healthy ROCE of over 20 per cent and continued deleveraging,"" it said.

Shares of Tata Motors DVR (Differential Voting Rights) rose 2.6 per cent to touch the Rs 301 mark on the BSE in Monday’s intra-day trade. The stock crossed Rs 300 after a gap of over six years. It was trading at its highest level since February 2017.Thus far in the calendar year, the market price of the company has surged 46 per cent as compared to a 2.6 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex.DVR shares are shares that are permitted to be issued with differential voting and differential dividend rights. DVR shares are different from ordinary shares in two distinct ways.Firstly, they offer lower voting rights compared to ordinary shares. These DVR shares are therefore useful for companies that want to raise money in the market without diluting effective control of the company. Secondly, to compensate for the lower voting rights, these DVR shares are paid a dividend premium of 10-20 per cent.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, this ideally should make sense for the small and retail shareholders as they normally do not participate in the voting process. Giving away part of their voting rights for higher dividends is a good ploy for these shareholders. Additionally, since DVRs have always quoted at a discount of 30-40 per cent in the Indian context, the higher dividend pay-out makes the DVR a lot more attractive in terms of dividend yields, the brokerage said.On May 12, the board of directors at its meeting has recommended a final dividend of Rs 2 per ordinary share of Rs 2 each (at 100 per cent) and Rs 2.10 per ‘A’ ordinary share of Rs 2 each (at 105 per cent) for the financial year ended March 31, 2023.Last week, Tata Motors had conducted its investor day with respect to Indian operations wherein the company said it was aiming to be net auto debt free by FY25 and capex for Indian operations pegged at around Rs 8,000 crore for FY24E with capex/investment in the electric vehicle (EV) business pegged at $2 billion by FY27 (majority on product and platform).With debt on a substantial downward trajectory and consequently interest outgo, it outlined its intention to commensurately increase dividends, going forward (positive for Tata Motors DVR shareholders), according to ICICI Securities.Further, the company also shared probable synergies and backward integration benefits with Tata Sons entity “Agratas”, which is putting up an EV cell manufacturing facility in India (in about two years with initial capacity of 20 GwH). Further, the company informed about Ford's Sanand plant to ramp up from H2FY24 and producing both ICE & EV.“We came away impressed by the background work that the company underlined behind its success in the PV space amid new forever series of products, its focus on design, safety and technology and ethos over sustainability,” the brokerage said in a note."

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCI Express

TCIE has established itself as a leading logistics player with a pan-India reach, which gives the company an advantage against competition. The company focuses on the profitable B2B segment, which accounts for ~95% of its business. It also has a good blend of customers, with 50% of its revenue coming from SMEs and the balance from Corporates. Over the years, TCIE has developed a robust Hub-and-Spoke infrastructure, comprising over 950 owned centers across 60,000 locations in the country. While new segments, Rail Express and C2C Express, are small parts of its overall business but are growing at a fast pace. TCIE expects these high-margin segments to form nearly 25% of its overall business in FY25 from ~18% currently. After commissioning an automated center in Gurugram in FY22, TCIE is looking to automate the Pune facility in FY24. It would improve the turnaround time and reduce costs. During FY23, TCIE incurred capex of INR1.25b, primarily for the purchase of land in Kolkata and Ahmedabad to set up new automated sorting center, a new corporate office in Gurgaon, and the network expansion by adding 35 new branches in key growing markets in the West and South regions.



Outlook

We expect TCIE to achieve volume/revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 11%/13%/21%/21% over FY23-25, aided by automation and the transition from rental sorting centers to an owned model, resulting in better operating efficiency. TCIE plans to incur capex of INR5b over next five years for setting up its own sorting centers. It intends to have its own sorting centers in 11 cities by FY26. With targeted capex, a debt-free balance sheet and a focus on the highly profitable B2B segment, the outlook for TCIE looks bright. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,850, based on 35x FY25E EPS.

394	TATACONSUM	Tata Consumer Products Ltd	Tata Consumer’s NourishCo to expand functional beverages portfolio	"NourishCo, a Tata Consumer Products Limited (TPCL) subsidiary, has introduced Tata Coffee Cold Brew as part of its strategy to expand its functional beverages segment.

The Tata Coffee Cold Brew is available in classic, mocha, and hazelnut variants and will be in the ready-to-drink category. The brew has low sugar content and will be available at select retail outlets. The drinks will be priced at ₹125.

We believe Tata Gluco Plus is a functional beverage, but we believe that there are many other opportunities in the functional beverage space. The Indian market is highly underpenetrated for packaged beverages, and packaged liquid beverages. we believe that there is significant scope to upgrade consumers from unpackaged to packaged.

It was trading at its highest level since February 2017.Thus far in the calendar year, the market price of the company has surged 46 per cent as compared to a 2.6 per cent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex.DVR shares are shares that are permitted to be issued with differential voting and differential dividend rights. DVR shares are different from ordinary shares in two distinct ways.Firstly, they offer lower voting rights compared to ordinary shares. These DVR shares are therefore useful for companies that want to raise money in the market without diluting effective control of the company. Secondly, to compensate for the lower voting rights, these DVR shares are paid a dividend premium of 10-20 per cent.According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, this ideally should make sense for the small and retail shareholders as they normally do not participate in the voting process. Giving away part of their voting rights for higher dividends is a good ploy for these shareholders. Additionally, since DVRs have always quoted at a discount of 30-40 per cent in the Indian context, the higher dividend pay-out makes the DVR a lot more attractive in terms of dividend yields, the brokerage said.On May 12, the board of directors at its meeting has recommended a final dividend of Rs 2 per ordinary share of Rs 2 each (at 100 per cent) and Rs 2.10 per ‘A’ ordinary share of Rs 2 each (at 105 per cent) for the financial year ended March 31, 2023.Last week, Tata Motors had conducted its investor day with respect to Indian operations wherein the company said it was aiming to be net auto debt free by FY25 and capex for Indian operations pegged at around Rs 8,000 crore for FY24E with capex/investment in the electric vehicle (EV) business pegged at $2 billion by FY27 (majority on product and platform).With debt on a substantial downward trajectory and consequently interest outgo, it outlined its intention to commensurately increase dividends, going forward (positive for Tata Motors DVR shareholders), according to ICICI Securities.Further, the company also shared probable synergies and backward integration benefits with Tata Sons entity “Agratas”, which is putting up an EV cell manufacturing facility in India (in about two years with initial capacity of 20 GwH). Further, the company informed about Ford's Sanand plant to ramp up from H2FY24 and producing both ICE & EV.“We came away impressed by the background work that the company underlined behind its success in the PV space amid new forever series of products, its focus on design, safety and technology and ethos over sustainability,” the brokerage said in a note."

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

The analysis of TCS AR23 not only highlights the widespread adoption of digital technologies in customer-facing operations, but also the increasing penetration of AI and automation in middle and back-office operations. With the growing intensity of adverse macro-economic environment in the latter half of the year, the clients are reprioritizing their spends and expressing interest in transforming their operating model. Apart from demand for driving operational efficiency and optimizing costs, Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY23. Despite demonstrating strong resilience, TCS anticipates the possibility of a moderate full-year revenue growth in FY24 if similar instances of delayed decision-making and cash conservation from clients reoccur.



Outlook

We maintain our positive stance on TCS. Our TP of INR 3,860 implies 25x FY25E EPS, with a 20% upside potential. We reiterate our BUY rating.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

Shares of TeamLease Services Ltd jumped over 4 percent after brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Securities has upgraded the stock and increased its target price.

At 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 2242 on BSE, up 4.3 percent from its previous close.

Motilal has upgraded TeamLease Services Ltd with a buy rating from neutral earlier and increased its target price to Rs 2,890 a share, up 34 percent from its current market price.

The upgrade came amid factors such as easing inflation, an expected increase in specialised staffing, and the presence of structural tailwinds. This along with increasing contribution from HR services (both high margin) should boost margins going forward, Motilal report said.

Motilal expects TeamLease to deliver a strong 17 percent revenue CAGR over FY23-25. The firm has seen 60 basis points drop in its profitability to 1.6 percent in FY23 due to wage increases in its general staffing vertical.

"" We view the current margin (1.6% for FY23) as the trough margin for TeamLease and expect the company to gradually improve profitability over next few years (+50bp over FY23 by FY25),"" the brokerage firm said.

Motilal also expects that the staffing industry, characterised by low market penetration, is poised to experience continuous growth in the foreseeable future. This can be attributed to the ongoing process of formalisation within the industry and the implementation of labour law reforms, which are expected to have a positive impact over the medium term.

""As both the central and state governments look to liberalise and formalise the labour market, TeamLease should be among the biggest direct beneficiaries in the medium term,"" Motilal Oswal said in its recent note.

The stock is down nearly 44 percent from its 52 week high of Rs 3,816.35 which hit on 27 July 2022 this has made stock attractive. The correction in the stock was due to concerns about growth moderation, especially in the specialised staffing vertical, and margin pressure. The staffing industry encountered challenges in terms of growth during FY23, primarily due to high inflation.

However, Motilal predicts a potential slowdown in technology staffing (specialised staffing) and certain segments of general staffing. Despite these short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for the sector remains strong and promising."

401	TECHM	Tech Mahindra Ltd	‘We should not consider Sam Altman anything other than an important man in AI’: MoS IT	"Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology has said that ChatGPT maker Sam Altman should not be considered anything other than an important man in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In an interview with MoneyControl, the minister spoke about Altman’s recent visit to India and the controversy on how it is hard to build foundational large language models in India.

“Sam Altman is a bright man who certainly has done a lot of work in OpenAI. And he has to be respected for his work. But we should not consider him anything other than an important man in AI. He's certainly not going to be the last word on what India's aspirations for AI are going to be. He certainly doesn't have an understanding of India's capabilities in AI.”

He added that his comments should be given the respect that it deserves but it is not fair to assume that everything he says or does is exactly what Indian startups are going to do. He further said that there will be fields where he and Altman will never agree.

The minister said that AI is an area where we will need to create Indian capability, “not government of India capability, but Indian startups and ecosystem capability… Maybe we'll end up doing it in partnership with him.”

A recent video shared by CP Gurnani, the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of Tech Mahindra, in which Altman can be heard stating that India's chances of developing a ChatGPT-like tool were ""hopeless"" sparked controversy.

Altman responded to the tweet, clarifying that his response was taken totally out of context. He elaborated that the response was to address the question of competing with OpenAI with a $10 million investment. He said that in this specific case, it will be difficult to attempt to rival OpenAI.

On being asked about Altman’s point of discussion with top leaders during his India visit, the minister revealed that Altman understands India’s potential. He added that there will be hundreds of opportunities for the Indian government, and startups to work together in the future.

During the India visit, Sam Altman met with PM Narendra Modi and tweeted saying, “great conversation with @narendramodi discussing India's incredible tech ecosystem and how the country can benefit from ai. Really enjoyed all my meetings with people in the @PMOIndia.”

401	TECHM	Tech Mahindra Ltd	Sam Altman says ‘hopeless’ for India to train ChatGPT-like AI, Tech Mahindra CEO says ‘challenge accepted’	"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made an exciting announcement on Twitter this week, revealing his plans for a six-nation tour that included India. True to his word, Altman arrived in India and engaged in various activities during his visit. At an event organised by The Economic Times, Altman was asked a thought-provoking question by Rajan Anandan, a former Vice President of Google in India and South East Asia and current venture capitalist. Anandan inquired about India's potential to develop an artificial intelligence tool like ChatGPT, seeking Altman's insights on where Indian startups should focus their efforts to create something significant in the field of AI.

Altman responded candidly, explaining the dynamics at play. He acknowledged India's vibrant ecosystem but expressed his belief that it would be challenging for Indian companies to compete with OpenAI on training foundation models. Despite his statement of doubt, Altman encouraged Indian entrepreneurs to undertake the challenge anyway.

""The way this works is we're going to tell you, it's totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models you shouldn't try, and it's your job to like try anyway. And I believe both of those things. I think it is pretty hopeless,"" Altman said.

CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of Tech Mahindra, was quick to share Altman's reply on Twitter, expressing his acceptance of the challenge presented. Gurnani conveyed his determination to prove Altman's statement wrong. ""OpenAI founder Sam Altman said it’s pretty hopeless for Indian companies to try and compete with them. Dear @sama, From one CEO to another.. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED,"" he tweeted.

“At Tech Mahindra, we started working on Generative AI around 2015-16 with one of our first IP created in the media domain called Storicool. An auto content creation platform, it was beyond its years. Since then, we have launched a suite of AI offerings for enterprises to help them in their digital acceleration journeys. We were also among the first IT services company whose chatbot, developed by makers lab, became the 51 most credible chatbots (in the era of chatbots) in 2016,” Gurnani told Business Today.

Furthermore, Gurnani highlighted Tech Mahindra's amplifAI0->∞ suite of AI offerings, which provides tailor-made, transformative, and agile solutions to organisations, unlocking the next level of growth. The suite includes a Generative AI studio, enabling enterprises to generate high-quality content outputs more efficiently. This comprehensive studio encompasses six aspects of content generation—Code, Document/Text, Image, Video, Audio, and Data—offering enterprises a centralised platform to explore the possibilities of Generative AI.

Meanwhile, Anandan, also undeterred by Altman's initial scepticism, chose to remain optimistic. He took to Twitter to thank Sam Altman for his response and emphasised that Indian entrepreneurs possess an indomitable spirit that should never be underestimated. ""Thank you, Sam Altman, for the clear answer. As you said, 'it is hopeless, but you will try anyway.' 5000 years of Indian entrepreneurship has shown us that we should never underestimate the Indian entrepreneur.

Outlook for June 13

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities

Markets were extremely range-bound to end with a positive bias on the back of firm global markets, as investors were cautiously optimistic ahead of the US FOMC meeting later this week. Although there are indications that the Fed may pause on rate hikes this time, any uptick in key rates could fuel pessimism over global growth and trigger a short-term correction.

Technically, the Nifty hovered between 18560 to 18630, and the narrow range activity clearly indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. For traders, 18550 would be the immediate support level, above which the index could move up till 18650-18700. On the other hand, a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 18550. Below the same, the index could slip till 18500-18450.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities

Cautious optimism was the preferred theme as benchmark Nifty fluctuated in a narrow range with investors gearing up for this week's key macroeconomic events like CPI & IIP data, US FOMC meeting and ECB rate decision. Technically, the Nifty has immediate support at 18463 and 18321, while resistance could be seen at 18778 and 18888 levels.

402	TITAN	Titan Company Ltd	Who Is The Half Brother Of Ratan Tata, Who Heads Titan And Westside And Has A Net Worth Of 13,000 Crores	"New Delhi: Who doesn't remember Ratan Tata? He was the previous head of the ""Tata Group."" Every time the term ""Tata Group"" is used, only Ratan Tata is meant. Ratan Tata deserves praise for elevating the ""Tata Group"" to a new degree of prominence in the world. But not much is known about his family. But here we're going to tell you about a notable family member of Ratan Tata, Noel Tata.

Who Is Noel Tata?

The 63-year-old is Ratan Tata's half-brother, who served as Tata Sons' former chairman. Although he is well-known within the company, Ratan, who is far more famous and has represented the business even after he retired, has always been the face of the outside world.

Noel Tata's Net Worth

Although Noel Tata's exact net worth is unknown yet, it is estimated to be over USD 1.5 billion, or roughly Rs 12,366 crore.

What Is The Relation Between Noel Tata And Ratan Tata?

Ratan Tata's half-brother is Noel Tata. Naval Tata, Ratan Tata's father, was a member of the family who Navajbai and Ratanji Tata adopted from an orphanage.

When Naval Tata was an adult, he wed Soonoo and they had two boys. The older son was given the name Ratan, and the younger son was given the name Jimmy. Naval and Soonoo split up sometime in the middle of the 1940s, and 10 years later, he married Simone, a Swiss national whom he allegedly met while she was on a trip to India.

Ratan Tata's half-brother Noel Tata is the son of Naval and Simone Tata.

What Does Noel Tata Do?

Noel Tata may not receive as much media attention as his half-brother Ratan Tata, but he nevertheless holds a number of significant positions inside several Tata-owned businesses.

He serves as managing director of Tata International, vice chairman of Titan Industries, chairman of Trent, the business that owns Westside, and chairman of Tata Investment Corporation.

Titan Company | Range-bound | Resistance: Rs 2,790 | Support: Rs 2,460

Titan Company shares have been continuously making higher high-low formations post the breakout from previous swing high of Rs 2,791 on the daily chart. However, the stochastic momentum indicator is witnessing a bearish crossover whereas the RSI is showing negative divergence on the daily scale. Overall, there are mixed signals are coming in from the daily charts. Until the stock gives a decisive close above Rs 3,000 level, there is a possibility of range-bound move ahead.

Watch: Stocks to watch on June 8, 2023: Bikaji Foods, Tata Elxsi, NHPC, Indus Towers, others

Tata Consumer Products | Bearish | Resistance: Rs 1,800 | Support: Rs 1,425

Tata Consumer has been hit sharply in the last one week. It formed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart. The sharp selloff has led the stock to drop towards its key support level of Rs 1,425. Around the similar juncture, the stock has formed a Double Top price pattern, but it needs decisive breakdown to carry this momentum further down. Going ahead, if the mentioned support zone breaches decisively, selling pressure would get extended towards the Rs 1,250 level.



Tata Motors | Buy in Rs 560-565 | Target Price: Rs 635 | Stop Loss: Rs 530

404	TTML	Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd	Book profits in Suzlon Energy, Mazagon Dock, select largecap auto, metal stocks: Aamar Deo Singh of Angel One	After a strong rally in stocks like Suzlon Energy Mazagon Dock , and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), which have given over 20% weekly returns, it is time to book partial profits and trail the balance, says Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel One. He also recommends part profit-booking in largecap metal and auto stocks as some short-term indicators display fatigue in Nifty.Nifty has gained over 10% in the past few months, bottoming out in March 2023, and is in striking distance of its all-time high of 18,887 witnessed in December 2023.Overall, the uptrend remains intact, but some of the short-term indicators are displaying fatigue, but overall, the bias is in favour of the bulls.However, we have been witnessing some profit booking at higher levels but given the upside momentum in the market with the broad-based rally, Nifty needs to sustain above the 18,650-18,670 zone for hitting new highs. On the downside, we see immediate support around the 18,200-18,250 zone.In the current quarter, Nifty Bank has rallied by over 8% to trade at record levels, and almost all the heavyweights in the banking & financial space contributed to this spectacular rally. However, of late, the HDFC twins appear to have lost momentum with the likes of the State Bank of India SBI ) and Kotak Mahindra Bank The RBI policy was already factored in by the market, so there was a muted reaction, as investors are well convinced that the central banks will go slow on hiking interest rates, as the inflationary trend appears to peak out. But still, that’s early days, so it is better to be cautious for any signal that appears to the contrary.Banking & Financials will be more of a pick-and-choose strategy, and the overall bullish momentum witnessed earlier across the board in this sector might not be the case in the near future, after all.Amongst the major metal stocks , primarily a rally was witnessed in the steel stocks such as Jindal Steel (8.34% WoW), JSW Steel (+5.93%), and Tata Steel (+0.83% WoW), leading to the overall upward move in Nifty Metal index, which ended the week up 1.40%.One should look at booking profits in this sector going forward.Talking about the auto sector, the Nifty Auto Index was up 3% this week, led by the likes of Tata Motors , Bajaj-Auto, HeroMoto MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland , and M&M, all of these were up by almost 4% this week, clearly indicating a broad-based rally. Investors are advised to book part profits and trail the balance.Overall, markets have witnessed a broad-based rally, indicating an increasing interest amongst investors and a growing sense of cautious optimism, as inflationary trends and global events still weigh on the minds of the investors.India VIX, around the 11 mark, is a sign of comfort, signalling that investors currently are not perturbed much by the happenings around the globe. Also, we see that more than 65% of the stocks are trading above their 200-day moving average, which is a positive sign, reflecting the underlying strength in the market.However, letting down one’s guard is never a wise thing to do in the market, as they say, markets are the most unpredictable places on earth. Having said that, focus on quality and valuations, for long-term entry.The surprise rate hike by the Bank of Canada caught most people off-guard, and given that the US Federal Reserve meets this week, to decide on the future course of action, speculations are rife that the US Fed could continue to adopt an aggressive stance, but most likely, press the pause button this time, analyzing the data, before its next policy meet.Also, hawkish words by US Fed officials recently suggested that interest rates could remain high for a longer time. Markets have factored in a no-hike scenario currently and are adopting a wait-and-watch policy, with alertness, as to how the event unfolds.All these stocks witnessed spectacular moves last week, and it's definitely windfall gains for the investors holding these stocks. Where most people are happy with 20% annualised returns, some stocks have generated 20% returns in a week.Hence, it is advisable to lock in profits, at least part-profits, so that notional profits do not remain paper profits. Most investors unfortunately are slow at booking profits and unable to capitalize on the gains. So booking some profits and trailing the balance, is a good way to capture the big moves so that one doesn’t miss out on the multi-baggers.

419	VEDL	Vedanta Ltd	Vedanta Group invites EOI for Sterlite Copper plant restart activities	"Vedanta Group has invited Expression of Interest (EOI) from companies to carry out plant restart activity at the Sterlite Copper plant in the port town of Thoothukudi. The copper smelting plant was shut down in 2018 following a prolonged protest by the locals, who had alleged that the plant was causing pollution and posing a health hazard.

The EOI mentions the scope of the work involves safety assessment/audit of structures and buildings and repair with the rectification of structures and buildings. Local vendors from Thoothukudi and other parts of Tamil Nadu will be given preference.

The contractors should have the potential to employ up to 4,000 individuals in and around Thoothukudi for deployment at the plant in various categories, including skilled and unskilled, at the plant. To equip these individuals for care and maintenance, overhauling, restart activities and plant operations, the contractors will be required to ensure skilling/upskilling of these individuals, as per the EOI.

The plant was set up in 1996 with a capacity of 4 lakh tonnes per annum. The plant facility included a rod plant, 160 MW captive power plant, oxygen plant, sulphuric acid plant, and phosphoric acid plant.

Also read: Will Vedanta prove that it will not be the next Adani?

The EOI reports that the plant has been creating 40 per cent of India’s demand for refined copper. In addition, it was the single largest producer of sulphuric acid in South India. The plant provided direct employment to about 4,000 people and 25,000 indirect jobs and working with 400 downstream MSMEs.

The plant contributed to the exchequer to the tune of over ₹13,000 crore in the previous five years up to FY18, according to the EOI.

Vedanta in statement said it had initiated the upkeep and maintenance activities at the plant as allowed by the Supreme Court on May 4, 2023, in coordination with the district authorities. The final hearing of the matter is scheduled in August 2023.

“We also recognise that the Sterlite Copper plant following its closure for over 5 years requires significant restoration efforts. As an industry leader with global technology and standards, the procurement and deployment of materials and resources necessary for the restoration and restart of the plant can be a time-consuming process, spanning several months. In the context, while we await the final judgment, the EoI is floated to ensure the best partners are identified as part of our preparatory measures for resource planning.

419	VEDL	Vedanta Ltd	Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper invites EoIs to ‘restart’ the Thoothukudi unit	"

""We have initiated the upkeep and maintenance activities at the plant as allowed by the Supreme Court vide its order dated May 4, 2023, in coordination with the district authorities. The final hearing of the matter is scheduled in August 2023,"" said a company official. Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta's Sterlite Copper on Monday came out with an advertisement inviting expression of interest (EoI) for carrying out plant ""restart activities"" at its Thoothukudi unit in Tamil Nadu, that got closed more than five years ago following an order issued by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). The EoI for restart comes when the company is still awaiting the final judgement on the issue, and the court has only allowed it to do maintenance work.



""We also recognise that the Sterlite Copper plant following its closure for over five years requires significant restoration efforts. As an industry leader with global technology and standards, the procurement and deployment of materials and resources necessary for the restoration and restart of the plant can be a time-consuming process, spanning several months. In the context, while we await the final judgment, the expression of interest (EOI) is floated to ensure the best partners are identified as part of our preparatory measures for resource planning,"" the official added. According to the advertisement, interested parties should be capable of employing around 4,000 people (both skilled and unskilled) in and around Thoothukudi. The scope of the EoI includes safety assessment and audit of the structures and building, repair and rectification, engaging with OEM or experts for certification, replacement of plant and machinery and commissioning of plant and machinery to achieve the designed capacity.



In early June, the district administration allowed the company to maintain the plant for operations like removing remaining gypsum and leachate handling operations, among others. This was based on a judgement by a three-member Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, Justice D Y Chandrachud, in May, allowing Sterlite Copper to carry out maintenance works. In addition, the interested parties should also look at mechanical fabrication and electrification works, electrical and instrumentation works, material handling equipment, scaffolding and painting jobs, civil and associated works and repair works, among others.

The plant was set up in 1996 and has a capacity of around 400,000 MTPA. Before its closure, the plant was catering to around 40 per cent of the country's refined copper demand. The plant facilities include a state-of-the-art rod plant, 160 mega-watts captive power plant, oxygen plant, wastewater treatment plant, sulphuric acid plant and phosphoric acid plant. Production at the plant has been suspended since 2018 after protests broke out against the firm's plan to double its annual capacity to 800,000 tonnes. Subsequent police firing caused the death of 13 people and injured 102. At the peak of the pandemic last April, the Supreme Court allowed the firm to produce oxygen for medical purposes."

On May 2, board of Varun Beverages decided to split its shares in the proportion of 1:2. For every existing share an investor holds, two additional shares will be issued by the company.

Varun Beverages said the split was being done to enhance the liquidity of the company's shares and to encourage the participation of small investors.

The stock split is likely to be completed in two months from the date of approval of the company's shareholders. Record date for the stock split will be determined once approval of shareholders is obtained.

Earnings performance

Varun Beverages reported a strong set of earnings for the quarter ended March 2023. The company follows the January-December format for results. Net profit in Q1 climbed 69 percent year-on-year to Rs 429 crore. Operating profit or EBITDA climbed 50 percent to Rs 798.1 crore.

EBITDA margin in the March quarter rose 170 basis points year-on-year to 20.5 percent.

Revenue rose 38 percent to Rs 3,893 crore on a year in year basis. Revenue growth was led by robust volume growth and an increase in net realisations. Sales volumes climbed 24.7 percent to 224.1 million cases, led by strong demand across India. Realisations in Q1 climbed 10.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 173.7 per case due to price hikes and improvement in energy drink mix of smaller SKUs.

421	ULTRACEMCO	UltraTech Cement Ltd	Sensex, Nifty settle flat; Nelco rises 14%, Ultratech gains 3%; IT stocks lag	"Domestic equity markets were able to recover from early cuts and ended flat amid mixed cues. Notionally, headline indices were able to extend their gains for the third straight session, positing almost negligible gains. Selling in the IT sector capped the gains, while traders await the RBI's monetary policy later this week.



For the day, the 30-share pack BSE Sensex added 5.41 points, or 0.01 per cent, to settle at 62,792.88, while NSE's Nifty50 rose 5.15 points, or 0.03 per cent, to end the session at 18,599. Broader market outperformed the headline peers as BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose about a half-a-per cent each. India VIX spiked slightly to 11.38-levels.



On a sectoral front, Nifty IT index topped the losers with a 2 per cent fall. Nifty Consumer Durables, Media, FMCG, Metals and PSU Bank indices were the other laggards. On the contrary, Nifty Auto and Realty indices added over a per cent each, while Nifty Pharma and Healthcare indices posted decent gains.



In the Nifty50 pack, Ultratech Cement surged about 3 per cent, leading the gainers. Divis Labs, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Grasim, Maruti Suzuki and Axis Bank added 2 per cent each. HDFC Life, Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Finserv, Mahindra & Mahindra and Eichers Motors were the other key gainers.



IT blue-chips Tech Mahindra, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services topped among the losers, falling 2 per cent each. Wipro, ONGC, HCL Technologies and Hindalco were the other losers. Coal India and Bharti Airtel shed a per cent each.



While the markets ended flat, buying was seen in rate-sensitive stocks like banking, auto and realty ahead of the RBI’s MPC meet later this week. With expectations rising that the central bank could once again take a pause on rate hike, hopes of steady interest rates going ahead triggered optimism in the rate-sensitives, said Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities.



""Technically, the market is consistently holding a higher bottom formation. For traders, 18,550 would be the trend decider level. Above the same, the index could move up to 18,700-18,750. On the flip side, below 18,550, uptrend would be vulnerable. Below the same, the market could retest the level of 18,480. Any further correction could drag the index till 18,440,"" he said.





The domestic market experienced profit booking due to selling pressure in the IT sector. IT stocks witnessed a decline in anticipation of further downward revision in spending, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.



""However, a rally in auto and banks helped to recover the losses. Going ahead an important influencer will be the commentary on growth and inflation forecasts by the RBI following its MPC meeting given the general consensus that rate pause will continue,"" he said.



A total of 3,659 shares were traded on BSE on Tuesday, of which 1,987 settled with gains. 1,544 stocks ended the session higher while 128 shares remained unchanged. A total of 262 shares hit their upper circuit, whereas 118 shares tested the lower circuit levels for the day.



In the broader markets, Meghmani Finechem surged over 14 per cent, while Nelco gained more than 13 per cent. HBL Power Systems and ADF Foods surged 12 per cent each, while Force Motors and Shara Cropchem added 11 per cent each for the day.



On the contrary, Nureca dropped more than 5 per cent, followed by Indo Count Industries, H-Tech Gears, Sintex Plastics and Vesuvius India which declined 5 per cent each. Persistent System, Inox Green and Manksia dropped more than 4 per cent each.

424	UFLEX	Uflex Ltd	Margins to still remain subdued in packaging films for next 1-2 quarters: Rajesh Bhatia, Uflex	"""They had no choice but to reduce their consumption for some of the things which are nice to have. And that is what affected the packaging industry because the demand for the energy, especially in the winters, is quite a bit and they had to reallocate their budgets based on the current energy prices ,"" says Rajesh Bhatia ,CFO, Uflex I think the demand in India was okay. The demand was subdued in Europe and America and the reasons are quite obvious because Europe had a huge turmoil when Russia went on conflict with Ukraine and with the higher energy prices which translated, which took away the consumer savings.So they had no choice but to reduce their consumption for some of the things which are nice to have. And that is what affected the packaging industry because the demand for the energy, especially in the winters, is quite a bit and they had to reallocate their budgets based on the current energy prices. Also what hit that, the higher interest rates in the US and Europe because the whole world was fighting with inflation and they had to increase their interest rates so even the mortgage payments because of the higher interest rates got affected. So when there was a reallocation of the home budgets, I think that was the point at which the demand got affected. So I think another quarter or so and then we can gauge the impact on the demand again. But as of now, it seems that the worst is over and we are looking to consolidate. The industry is looking to consolidate.I think next quarter or so, they will still remain subdued in the packaging films. After that, I think the margins will improve. So there is no point in hiking the prices when the demand is low and give up your market share.So I think we will have to wait for another quarter till we see the improvement in the margins, especially in the global markets. India is intact and in fact, India, FY23 was our highest ever production, our highest ever sales, our highest ever top line, highest ever profitability led by the growth in the packaging, demand for packaging, both flexible and aseptic. And we had as much as 33% growth in our packaging business in FY23, which momentum we are continuing now in FY24 as well.When I look at April and May, in aseptic packaging, we are already working at about 20% of our rated capacity of the plant. So the India story remains very, very bullish. And it is another quarter before we will be able to come back and say as to what are the guidance in the other world markets we operate in.I think most of the capacity additions which were to come up in the PET side are already accounted for. I do not think so going forward in FY24 and FY25 there is any substantial capacity expansion that is happening. So whatever was to happen has already happened in FY23. And that is where in FY23 when there was a situation of oversupply at the same time we had the situations in Europe and America which led to a decreased consumption.And so it was a double whammy; on the one side you have the excess supply and on the other hand the existing demand also goes down as against a normal 3, 3.5% growth in the mature markets of the world so that really affected, impacted the margins as well as the volumes.And when the volumes are also impacted, your cost unit mechanism also goes for a toss. So you have a higher cost which translates into higher unit costing and your margins are impacted. So, it is a vicious cycle. But last two quarters as we see Q3 was bad, Q4 was much better as compared to Q3 in these markets. And in April and May also we have seen some upside. At least in India we have seen a better margin profile in the month of April and May, in the industry as a whole.I think there is no thought process as of now, but we get a lot of ideas like this but at this moment certainly there is nothing on the anvil. And as and when obviously there are plans to do that, being a listed company we will have to announce it to the markets. We will do that at that point in time but certainly nothing on the anvil for the time being."

431	VMART	V-mart Retail Ltd	Next few months should be good for sugar stocks: Sandip Sabharwal	"""So, next few months should be good for sugar stocks. The key we will need to watch out subsequent to this and the start of the next sugar season is given that there are elections next year,"" says Sandip Sabharwal , asksandipsabharwal.com.So, the sugar stocks are reasonably priced given the fact that we are on the cusp of a potential upswing in domestic sugar prices and the sugar company profitability tends to be very leveraged to that because all their costs are fixed.So, every rupee increase in sugar prices effectively goes to the bottom line. So, as many of the companies also indicated post the current year production data and inventory situation that prices from here on till the start of the next crushing season, October-November, festival season should trend up and they have started trending up a bit also.So, next few months should be good for sugar stocks . The key we will need to watch out subsequent to this and the start of the next sugar season is given that there are elections next year. What happens to the sugarcane advice price, etc, and that has an impact on profitability. So, that is the small uncertainty which is there for sugar companies. Ex of that the story looks reasonable.Yes, the initial run-up was based on assumptions of a particular amount of growth, like people assumed that the company will keep on growing at 30-40% with high margins forever. As the last few years have shown, the growth has moderated, margins have moderated and in a slowdown typically the value plays do better but that also has not happened in Avenue Supermart So, at the current prices, stock is at some 80 price-earning ratio where earnings growth should be just around 10 odd percent, not more than that and maybe we will see an uptick next year. So, on what basis people are giving a buy on this stock is totally beyond me.I think specifically V-Mart has some other issues going for it. I think it is in a bigger trouble, DMart is still a cash generating company. So, if you have to make a choice, I think the choice has to be DMart or Avenue Supermarts but I am not buying.I think that is the challenge always in buying into companies which are prone to government decisions taking away or bringing about huge profitability swings. So I think that is the challenge that all the OMCs stocks also face, and that is the challenge now IEX faces.So I think it is tough to say. I think people should avoid this stock because as it is, I think the performance of the stock always used to pick up during summer when the electricity shortage rates go up and then cool off. So in any case, it is a cyclical stock. And on top of that, if you have government intervention, then obviously the story becomes more sour.I think we are seeing incremental improvements at Maruti from first being in denial two-three years back the changes which were happening in the market space to adapting to that and I think that is driving the stock price also. And I believe Maruti will continue to do well.So I do not see it as a challenge to M&M's Thar but I think it should be a complementing product because the market share as it is low of these products.And as consumers see more of these products, we typically see it complementing rather than having a cannibalising effect. So I think to that extent, it is good for category growth. How this particular product does is something which is tough to predict which as it was, how the market will take it, we have to see.Yes, I agree with that and I think it is the same story on some of the like even Bajaj Auto etc. First, these companies were in denial about EV moves then they accepted it. And now, my view always was that all these start-ups in the two wheeler EV space, they will eventually not do well. And once the bigger players realise that this is what is the market trend, they will gain market share and they will become dominant and that is something which has started to happen. I would agree that Hero MotoCorp incremental positives might be greater. It is under owned stock now. So if the rural revival also plays out, then we should see Hero MotoCorp do better.DLF was the first one to recognize that for a real estate company to have sustainable growth, they need to correct their balance sheet. They did it. The market did not reward them for a very long time and now once the sales pickup has happened, the stocks got rewarded and moved much higher. Oberoi Realty obviously is more Mumbai play but they have also done well but seems to be richly priced at this stage. So I think people should wait for better opportunities to buy into it. Overall, directionally, longer term real estate story looks fine but after the near term uptick I think there is lesser value in the near term in most of these stocks.No, there is nothing in that. So it is just that whenever the trading or short term positions get too intense in a particular stock or set of stocks, then we see such moves because the short term players who do not really know why they are buying or selling tend to sell and buy. So I think that this is a regular phenomenon, I do not think we should pay too much attention to it.If the banking or the financial sector holds through its asset quality in an interest rate up cycle, then typically it should do better. And I think that is a very strong position which the Indian economy has and which most people fail to recognize that you have the financials in such a strong position with record low NPAs and buffers in their balance sheet and high capital adequacy ratio across the board, that it can help fuel economic growth for a longish time, without even them having to raise capital. So I think the financial sector is in a very good health."	"""So, next few months should be good for sugar stocks.

434	WIPRO	Wipro Ltd	At Wipro, future hikes to depend on upskilling, reskilling, says HR boss	"

Saurabh Govil, the company's head of human resources, told this to the Times of India during an interview, while emphasising the importance of acquiring ""niche skills"" such as generative AI and cybersecurity. Wipro has stated that future salary hikes for its employees would be based on their efforts to upskill and reskill themselves.



Govil, who has been Wipro's Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) for over 30 years, also mentioned the increasing role of generative AI in the company. As this technology progresses, routine tasks like analysis will be automated, shifting employees' focus towards more complex work. In the interview, Govil stated that new employees will no longer be hired with a straight 30 per cent pay raise, which was done in 2021 when there were many opportunities and high attrition rates. However, those who possess niche skills such as generative AI and cybersecurity will receive a premium.



These comments from Wipro's HR chief come at a time when 92 per cent of incoming freshers have accepted the company's proposal to start at a lower salary (Rs 3.5 lakh per year) compared to the original offer (Rs 6.5 lakh per year), according to a report by Hindustan Times. Regarding Wipro's use of artificial intelligence, Govil explained that the company aims to have 80 per cent of HR queries handled by bots. Human resources professionals will then be able to concentrate on coaching managers and leaders in team building and improving their management skills.

With courses becoming easily accessible and affordable, companies also appear to be expecting employees to take advantage of these. However, whether Wipro will provide any monetary or any other forms of support to employees pursuing any form of upskilling and reskilling was not mentioned in the interview. Reskilling and upskilling became buzzwords among corporates during the Covid-19 lockdowns that required people to quickly adapt to new work environments. Online skilling platforms like Unacademy and upGrad joined the unicorn club in September 2020, and 2021, respectively due to the surge in demand for online courses."

434	WIPRO	Wipro Ltd	TCS, Infosys, and Wipro: The poor math behind some share buybacks	"In finance circles it is said: “Buybacks are divisive, they divide people who understand finance from those who don’t!’ But these days, even those who are experts in finance are divided.

Warren Buffet, in his latest annual newsletter, called stock buyback critics ‘economic illiterate’. On the other hand, Jeremy Grantham — market historian and a successful investor by his own right — recently criticised buybacks as they enable market manipulation amongst other things. Confused? Well, there is some truth to both. Buffet has caveated his view noting that buybacks add value if done at value-accretive prices. Jeremy Grantham’s point, too, has some merit as buyback announcements manipulate the market by causing imbalances between supply and demand, leading to arbitrage players taking advantage.

Plus, buybacks also signal that the management knows something!

Indian corporate boards and managements, especially from the IT sector (which makes up for a significant majority of buybacks), would do well to pay heed to this debate. With the record date for the Wipro buyback set for June 16, we analysed how well the buybacks in the sector have fared. The results are clear: unless done at cheaper value accretive prices, shareholders who did not participate in the buyback lose out.

Short cash/buy stock

Take for instance TCS’ buybacks announced in Q3FY21 and Q4FY22. The buybacks were done at a very pricey 34- and 44-times PE. Buybacks are transactions where cash is sold/shorted to buy stock.

The transaction works for the buyer of stock only when the intrinsic value of the stock is higher than the value of cash. Either earnings yield (1/PE) must be higher than the interest rate on cash, or an accelerating earnings growth environment must be ahead for the company.

Both were clearly not the case for the top players in the IT sector. This is reflected in the poor subsequent stock CAGR from the buyback price for most of the buybacks done in the sector in the last three years. TCS’ FY22 buyback involved buying the stock with earnings yield of 2.27 per cent by selling cash which could have earned well over five per cent.

However, the buyback done by TCS and Infosys in pre-Covid times when the stocks were trading at more reasonable multiples have fared better and have given decent, if not great returns.

HCL Tech, which did a buyback in FY19 at much more reasonable prices — at a PE of 16 times (earnings yield of 6.25 per cent) — has delivered the best returns.

Shareholders’ money

At the end of the day, buybacks are shareholders’ money returned to them, and so is the case with dividends. If the company does not have use for that cash, they are better off of returning it to shareholders rather than keeping it idle in their balance sheet or making a wrong capital allocation. To that extent, buybacks cannot be criticised.

However, the data from the IT sector over the last few years indicates that boards/managements could have distributed this money as dividends when the shares were expensively valued, the way HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra have done.

Buyback returns money to a few shareholders, while dividends return money to all the shareholders. In case of an overpriced buyback, those who participated (less optimistic on company prospects versus other uses of the cash) benefited at the expense of those who did not.

The taxation difference making buybacks via tender offer route more tax efficient could have been a factor as to why some managements choose buybacks over dividends. However, it needs to be noted that this comes with a signalling effect to investors, many of whom might be inclined to view it as an indication that stocks are undervalued. And why not? Wasn’t that one of the primary reasons why buybacks were conceived in the first place?"	"Warren Buffet, in his latest annual newsletter, called stock buyback critics ‘economic illiterate’.

440	ZENSARTECH	Zensar Technologies Ltd	IT stocks: Weak EPAM guidance sends Persistent, Mphasis, Coforge, Cyient shares falling; TCS, Infosys down 2% each	"Concerns over demand slowdown in discretionary spending in IT sector sent many midcap IT shares such as Persistent Systems, Mphasis, Coforge and Cyient tumbling in Tuesday's trade, even as largecap stocks such as TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech restricted losses. This is as US-based EPAM Systems cut its Calendar 2023 revenue growth outlook again, expecting a 2 per cent decline in revenues in the constant currency terms at the mid-point of the guided band.

Analysts noted that EPAM has been hit by high exposure to discretionary spending and certain company-specific factors and that domestic Indian IT firms have a more balanced portfolio between discretionary and maintenance spending.

Yet, ""we believe the recent run-up in the sector has been ahead of fundamentals,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. ""We believe that upsides do exist in Infosys and HCL Technologies but are wary of other names,"" it added.

Shares of Persistent Systems plunged 4.62 per cent to Rs 4,973.50. Coforge shares slipped 3.82 per cent to Rs 4,418. 40. Mphasis, Cyient and Zensar Technologies declined 3.71 per cent, 3.10 per cent and 2.80 per cent, respectively. LTIMindtree dropped 2.14 per cent to Rs 4,838. Among largecaps, Tech Mahindra also declined 2.20 per cent ti Rs 1,084. TCS fell 1.81 per cent while Infosys skidded 2 per cent. HCL Tech and WIpro declined 1.4 per cent each.

""Delays in client decision-making and pullbacks in discretionary spending have implications for the growth of Indian IT. We expect revenues in 1QFY24E to be weaker than 4QFY23 across companies in our coverage universe. We believe that the demand environment is especially weak in the financial services and technology segments. A prolonged recovery in clients’ willingness to spend would imply downside risks to FY2024 revenue growth estimates. Noting the weak demand, we are surprised by the rally in stock prices across our coverage in the past month,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The brokerage said Indian IT will benefit from cost take-out programs and mega-deals. However, these positives are outweighed by the broader caution in spending, especially in the impacted verticals, it said.

""SaaS and digital engineering companies’ commentary and revenue guidance suggests weak demand in the Jun’23 quarter with subsequent revival of demand in H2FY24/H2CY23 because, even though the sales cycle is lengthening, pipeline is not shrinking. Plus, there is demand from cost optimisation opportunities,"" said ICICIdirect.

This brokerage believes that weakness in revenue growth in 2023 is largely priced in the stock prices at current valuations, with Nifty IT index trading at 22 times one-year forward EPS, 2 epr cent premium to 5-year average PE.

""We continue to prefer Infosys (BUY) and Persistent Systems (BUY), followed by LTIMindtree (BUY) and TCS (BUY),"" it said.

He also recommends part profit-booking in largecap metal and auto stocks as some short-term indicators display fatigue in Nifty.Nifty has gained over 10% in the past few months, bottoming out in March 2023, and is in striking distance of its all-time high of 18,887 witnessed in December 2023.Overall, the uptrend remains intact, but some of the short-term indicators are displaying fatigue, but overall, the bias is in favour of the bulls.However, we have been witnessing some profit booking at higher levels but given the upside momentum in the market with the broad-based rally, Nifty needs to sustain above the 18,650-18,670 zone for hitting new highs. On the downside, we see immediate support around the 18,200-18,250 zone.In the current quarter, Nifty Bank has rallied by over 8% to trade at record levels, and almost all the heavyweights in the banking & financial space contributed to this spectacular rally. However, of late, the HDFC twins appear to have lost momentum with the likes of the State Bank of India SBI ) and Kotak Mahindra Bank The RBI policy was already factored in by the market, so there was a muted reaction, as investors are well convinced that the central banks will go slow on hiking interest rates, as the inflationary trend appears to peak out. But still, that’s early days, so it is better to be cautious for any signal that appears to the contrary.Banking & Financials will be more of a pick-and-choose strategy, and the overall bullish momentum witnessed earlier across the board in this sector might not be the case in the near future, after all.Amongst the major metal stocks , primarily a rally was witnessed in the steel stocks such as Jindal Steel (8.34% WoW), JSW Steel (+5.93%), and Tata Steel (+0.83% WoW), leading to the overall upward move in Nifty Metal index, which ended the week up 1.40%.One should look at booking profits in this sector going forward.Talking about the auto sector, the Nifty Auto Index was up 3% this week, led by the likes of Tata Motors , Bajaj-Auto, HeroMoto MotoCorp, Ashok Leyland , and M&M, all of these were up by almost 4% this week, clearly indicating a broad-based rally. Investors are advised to book part profits and trail the balance.Overall, markets have witnessed a broad-based rally, indicating an increasing interest amongst investors and a growing sense of cautious optimism, as inflationary trends and global events still weigh on the minds of the investors.India VIX, around the 11 mark, is a sign of comfort, signalling that investors currently are not perturbed much by the happenings around the globe. Also, we see that more than 65% of the stocks are trading above their 200-day moving average, which is a positive sign, reflecting the underlying strength in the market.However, letting down one’s guard is never a wise thing to do in the market, as they say, markets are the most unpredictable places on earth. Having said that, focus on quality and valuations, for long-term entry.The surprise rate hike by the Bank of Canada caught most people off-guard, and given that the US Federal Reserve meets this week, to decide on the future course of action, speculations are rife that the US Fed could continue to adopt an aggressive stance, but most likely, press the pause button this time, analyzing the data, before its next policy meet.Also, hawkish words by US Fed officials recently suggested that interest rates could remain high for a longer time. Markets have factored in a no-hike scenario currently and are adopting a wait-and-watch policy, with alertness, as to how the event unfolds.All these stocks witnessed spectacular moves last week, and it's definitely windfall gains for the investors holding these stocks. Where most people are happy with 20% annualised returns, some stocks have generated 20% returns in a week.Hence, it is advisable to lock in profits, at least part-profits, so that notional profits do not remain paper profits. Most investors unfortunately are slow at booking profits and unable to capitalize on the gains. So booking some profits and trailing the balance, is a good way to capture the big moves so that one doesn’t miss out on the multi-baggers.

467	ZOMATO	Zomato Ltd	Zomato shares rise 4% to hit new 52-week high; analysts see more steam left in the stock	"Shares of Zomato jumped about 4 per cent during the trading session on Monday and hit a new 52-week high as the stock was seen above Rs 80-mark during the trading session. The stock has surpassed its issue price more than one year after, giving relief to investors.



Shares of Zomato were listed on July 23, 2021 when the company raised Rs 9,375 crore via its primary offering selling its shares at Rs 76 apiece. After making a record high of Rs 161 in November 2021, the stock has been hammered severely after lower profitability and liquidity tightening. The stock crashed about 75 per cent to Rs 40.55 on July 27, 2022.



However, the stock has been in the momentum recently after strong quarterly results, the path to profitability on operational levels and a positive outlook by the brokerage firms. The stock has gained more than 25 per cent in the last one month, while it has gained about 35 per cent in the year 2023 so far.



Shares of Zomato rose about 4 per cent on Monday to Rs 80.30, its new 52-week high and the total market capitalization of the company was slightly shy of Rs 70,000 crore mark. The scrip had settled at Rs 77.57 on Friday.



Zomato reported better-than-expected operating performance in the March 2023 quarter, while it registered muted gross order value (GOV) growth quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), contribution margin across segments beat estimates. Zomato's business, excluding quick commerce, turned positive adjusted Ebitda, in the March quarter.



Zomato reported a narrowing of losses at Rs 188.20 crore for the March 2023 quarter compared with Rs 346.60 crore in the December quarter and Rs 359.70 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter rose 69.66 per cent to Rs 2,056 crore for the quarter compared with Rs 1,211.80 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.



Zomato has introduced differential pricing to their food delivery subscription packages, in a bid to improve contribution margin (CM) from such customers. The differential pricing seems targeted and aims to better monetize higher-frequency customers while incentivizing low-frequency customers to join the subscription program, said Kotak Institutional Equities.



Also, Blinkit is fast scaling down losses, and the weakening competitive intensity should aid CM breakeven in FY2024 for the business. We now ascribe an Rs 80 billion valuation to this business. We bake in higher take rates for Zomato over FY2024-26E, while broadly retaining medium-term estimates, resulting in a 14-65 per cent increase in FY2025-26E EBITDA, it added.



Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained its 'buy' tag on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 95, suggesting another 23 per cent upside in the stock. Similarly, Nuvama Institutional Equities had revised target price on the stock to Rs 94 (from Rs 85 earlier) in May 2023.



""We expect Zomato to maintain its market leadership in the food delivery segment. Zomato’s relaunch of its Gold membership plan should bring back growth. Meanwhile, improved profitability is a clear demonstration of operating efficiencies playing out. Our note reflects our positive stance backed by improved profitability,"" said Nuvama.



Another brokerage firm JM Financial had given a buy call on Zomato with a target price of Rs 105 in May 2023 and remains one of the top picks from the Indian internet sector, while Emkay Financial had a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 90.

The next ten years will look really good for beauty and retail… this is a multi-decade story,” he said.Speaking about increased competition in the beauty market with the entry of some of India’s largest business groups including Reliance Retail-backed Tira and Tata CLiQ Palette, Nair said: “Competition has been around since we started, that time also we would be asked how we would 'Amazon-proof' our business. It’s not like there were no competitors in 2012”.He said Nykaa would continue to focus on what it does best. “We understand this consumer better than anyone else.. Having said that, newer competitors will expand the market and accelerate consumption of the category,” he told ET, at an event to announce scale up plans for the Estee Lauder Companies (ELC)-backed New Incubation Ventures , a strategic early-stage investment and incubation arm which invests in beauty businesses, in partnership with Nykaa.The ELC on Wednesday announced the second edition of Beauty&You, a platform created by New Incubation Ventures in partnership with Nykaa.New Incubation Ventures will scale up partnerships with founders and entrepreneurs to fund emerging beauty brands and new business models, Shana Randhava, senior vice president, New Incubation Ventures, ELC, said. “With a higher degree of consumer awareness and an influx of options, India represents an exciting opportunity for the global beauty ecosystem,” she said.Randhava said the platform will identify opportunities strategically and identify more brands to invest in. “We have set a target of doing 5-7 investments in a year. We are long-term investors and will invest not only dollars but resources as well,” she said.For the quarter ended March 31, FSN E-Commerce Ventures , which operates Nykaa,saw its net profit fell 72% year-on-year to Rs 2.3 crore impacted by higher raw material price, employee-related costs and tax expenses.However, revenue from operations went up 34% to Rs 1,302 crore over the corresponding year-ago quarter.Nykaa debuted on the stock market in November 2021 with a healthy listing, but lost out its initial momentum as tech stocks came under severe pressure globally.While a spate of direct-to-consumer brands are pushing entry-level packs, Nykaa will continue to straddle premium products and mass brands. Nayar said the company would also continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions across beauty and fashion verticals.Besides its own label,Estee Lauder Companies’ products are sold under Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, M·A·C, and Bobbi Brown.The size of India’s beauty and personal care market is forecasted to reach Rs 2.2 lakh crore by 2025.

475	POLICYBZR	PB Fintech Ltd	Policybazaar expands revenue share from new business lines	Gurugram-based insurance broker Policybazaar is quickly expanding the share of revenue from its new business lines as it diversifies from just being a consumer-focussed online insurance distribution platform. PBFintech , which is a publicly listed entity and owns insurance distributor Policybazaar and credit aggregator Paisabazaar, generated Rs 365 crore of revenue in the fourth quarter of the last financial year from its new initiatives.This number has gone up 137% from Rs 154 crore in the fourth quarter of last year. In the last quarter, PBFintech reported an overall operational revenue of Rs 869 crore, up 60% from Rs 540 crore in the year prior.From around 28% of its overall revenue coming from its new initiatives, Policybazaar has now pushed the share to 42% in one year. PB Fintech joint group CEO Sarbvir Singh told ET that the new initiatives at Policybazaar are doing good business with overall losses in this segment having come down to Rs 36 crore in the last quarter from around Rs 90 crore in the fourth quarter of last year.Policybazaar started three major lines under the new initiatives: PB Partners , PB Corporate and its business in the Gulf. The first two business lines opened up after the insurance intermediary received the insurance broking licence from Insurance Regulator and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) in 2021.Under PB Partners, Policybazaar works with a network of physical agents. Under the corporate business, it sells B2B insurance products like fire, marine, directors and officers insurance and offers employer-employee insurance cover too.The company did not provide revenue details for each of its business segments.During the investor call after its fourth quarter earnings, PBFintech said that it gets around 34% of its non-motor business from its agent network that covers around 15,000 pin codes in the country.Policybazaar cofounder Yashish Dahiya had pointed out on the call that currently the businesses are operating at a margin of negative 1%, almost breaking even from negative 51% at its peak.Through the offline business and the B2B arm, the listed insurance major competes with other insurtech startups like Turtlemint, Plum, Pazcare and others.Policybazaar, with its strong brand recall and its financial might, is working aggressively to corner a large chunk of these business lines. Singh pointed out that these business lines are not only about shiny apps and technology but require hard-nosed bargaining with large corporations.This space is also dominated by large brokers like Marsh and others. With an expansive sales team and an experience of selling insurance for the last 15 years, Singh said that he is confident of closing large deals with corporations for not only their general insurance requirements but also to protect their employees.PBFintech said 4,000 companies have taken employee insurance and around 25,000 firms have taken some kind of insurance product from it.“We had acquired this company Visit Internet and for this part of the business they work with us. We offer this platform to the corporates we onboard,” said Singh.Through the app, employees can raise claims, track reimbursements and integrate with health trackers, Singh added.“In some cases where we have offered this service to startups or companies where employees get multiple insurance benefits, we have seen the engagement on the app being as high as around 70% to 80%,” Singh said.Despite this business being more than a year old, renewal rates continue to remain low. Talking about the corporate business, Singh told ET that it is a very competitive business and renewals need tough negotiations.“But we have a strong capability to play a significant role in this business in the long term,” Singh said.

475	POLICYBZR	PB Fintech Ltd	Paytm & PB Fintech shares: BofA revises ratings; check new target prices	"Shares of One97 Communications, the parent company of financial services platform Paytm, and PB Fintech, the parent company of PolicyBazaar and PaisaBazaar, were on the radar of the traders as the BofA Securities revised the ratings and target prices for the given new age companies.



The global brokerage firm has upgraded Paytm to 'buy' with a higher target price, while it has downgraded PB Fintech to 'underperform' with a lower target price. The stock reacted to the news in a similar fashion. Presently, PB Fintech is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 6 times for the FY25E, while Paytm at 3 times.



Shares of One97 Communications surged more than 8 per cent on Thursday to Rs 785.50, before giving up their gains partially. The company topped Rs 50,000 crore in market capitalisation during the session. The stock settled at Rs 727 on Wednesday.



Shares of Paytm have gained more than 50 per cent return in the year 2023 so far, while the stock is up about 12 per cent in the last one month. However, it is still more than 60 per cent down from its issue price of Rs 2,150.



BofA Securities upgraded Paytm to 'buy' and raised its price target on the stock to Rs 855 from Rs 780 earlier. BofA said that Paytm possesses potential for positive operational leverage and sits in a 'sweet spot' due to limited competition. It also highlighted other positive factors such as the growth of digitalization driving payments and the company's robust cash balance.



Paytm's loan disbursals rose by more than 50 per cent in May compared to the same period last year. Paytm also highlighted its success in offline payments, with 75 lakh merchants now subscribing to payment devices, representing a growth of 4 lakh merchants in May 2023.



On the other hand, It downgraded PB Fintech to underperform with a target price of Rs 600 apiece. BofA said that the path to the company achieving Rs 1,000 crore in profits is well-flagged, but it is currently witnessing slowing growth on a high base. The brokerage called PB Fintech a good company but added that the improved profitability metrics are more or less priced in.



Following the downgrade, Shares of PB Fintech dropped more than 3 per cent to Rs 623.20 on Thursday and the company's market capitalization slipped below Rs 28,000 crore mark. Shares of PB Fintech had hit their 52-week high at Rs 665.40 on Wednesday as the stock has risen about 45 per cent in the year 2023 so far.

475	POLICYBZR	PB Fintech Ltd	BoFA downgrades PB Fintech, Paytm awarded with upgrade; shares react	"Representative Image

Shares of new-age fintech companies, Paytm operator One97 Communications and PB Fintech were in focus on June 8 after global research and broking firm Bank of America Securities changed its ratings for the two stocks.

BoFA upgraded its rating for One97 Communications to 'buy' while also raising its price target for the stock by nearly 10 percent to Rs 855. The broking firm cited expectations of a strong revenue momentum for the company as the reason behind the upgrade.

The brokerage holds the view that Paytm possesses significant potential for positive operational leverage and sits in a 'sweet-spot' due to limited competition. Additionally, BoFA also highlighted other positive factors such as the growth of digitalization driving payments and the company's robust cash balance.

Shares of One97 Communications also reacted positively to the ratings upgrade and at 12.21 pm, were trading at Rs 769.50 on the NSE, up 5.85 percent from the previous close. The stock also hit an intraday high of Rs 785.95 earlier in the session.

At a stark contrast, an opposite reaction was seen in the shares of PB Fintech, as BoFA downgraded the stock to 'underperform' with a price target of Rs 600. The broking firm is of the view that the improving prospects of the PolicyBazaar operator are already factored in the current valuations.

The firm noted that though the journey towards PB Fintech achieving Rs 1,000 crore in profits is well-known, the company is still facing a slowdown in growth due to a high base. While acknowledging PB Fintech as a good company, the brokerage believes that the market has already factored in the improved profitability metrics to a large extent.

Currently, PB Fintech is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 6 times for the FY25, while Paytm is at 3 times. Aside from that, BoFA also expressed concerns that increased competition from peers like InsuranceDekho, who recently raised capital, might hinder PB Fintech's accelerated path towards achieving Rs 1,000 crore in profits.

As a result, shares of PB Fintech slipped in trade and at 12.27 pm, were trading with a cut of 2 percent at Rs 631.50 on the NSE.

Consider this: In March 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said daily UPI transactions crossed 360 million. The integration of UPI with third-party applications such as Google Pay, Paytm, PhonePe, and BHIM enables users to initiate transactions through their bank accounts and debit cards effortlessly. But now these platforms have extended their capabilities to select credit cards, offering users a broader range of payment options.

First things first: To utilise UPI with your credit card, you’ll need to apply for a RuPay credit card from a bank that supports this UPI feature such as Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Union Bank of India among others. Once approved, you can manually link your physical card to payment apps that are compatible with credit transactions on UPI.

Here are steps to link your third-party apps such as GPay, Paytm, PhonePe with your Rupay Credit card

Step 1: Open your app—GPay/PhonePe/Paytm

Using the steps above RuPay Credit Card customers can directly link their credit cards with the UPI applications of their choice, such as BHIM, PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay, MobiKwik and PayZapp.

PhonePe, recently announced that it had achieved two significant milestones. The company has become the first digital payments app to successfully enable the linkage of 200,000 RuPay credit cards to the UPI. In addition, PhonePe has also processed a Total Payment Value (TPV) of Rs 150 crore via RuPay Credit on UPI.

Sonika Chandra, Vice President of Consumer Platform and Payments at PhonePe, stated in a press release, “We are thrilled to become the first payments app to link two lakh Rupay credit cards to UPI.

Shares of One97 Communications, the operator of Paytm, gained over 3 percent on June 9, a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approved the First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG) programme.

The FLDG is a popular product that fintechs in the country use to form partnerships with banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). It helps banks and NBFCs cover potential losses, as well as gives them confidence that fintechs understand credit risk. Under FLDG, fintechs help banks and NBFCs recoup losses that occur when customers default on payments.

At 2.45 pm, the stock was quoting at Rs 801.90 on the NSE, higher by 3.8 percent from the previous close. The stock has been on a three-day gaining streak and is up over 12 percent.

Before the digital lending norms were introduced, fintechs and banks had developed an FLDG model on their own where the former provided a guarantee to compensate for up to a certain percentage of default in a loan portfolio.

Now, the RBI has approved the model and capped the amount at 5 percent of the total loan value.

On a high

Paytm is now at a nine-month high. From a technical perspective, if it fills another bearish gap of August 12, 2022 and reclaims its swing high of last August of Rs 844, then it could see a big rise, experts said.

In the quarter ended March 2023, Paytm parent significantly brought down its losses. The company’s consolidated net loss narrowed to Rs 168 crore from Rs 761 crore a year ago, and Rs 392 crore a quarter ago. Consolidated revenue from operations surged by nearly 52 percent YoY to Rs 2,335 crore.

BoFA upgraded its rating for One97 Communications to 'buy' while also raising its price target for the stock by nearly 10 percent to Rs 855. The broking firm cited expectations of a strong revenue momentum for the company as the reason behind the upgrade.

“We wish to inform you that Mr. Venkatasamy Jagannathan, vide email dated June 10, 2023, has tendered his resignation from the Board of the Company with immediate effect, i.e., from June 10, 2023,” the company said in a communiqué to stock exchanges.

On April 28, 2023, the company said “Jagannathan, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Ltd., has relinquished his position as CEO and would continue as Non-Executive Director and Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, which will be effective from the close of business hours on May 4, 2023.”

However, with his resignation, Jagannathan has quit the board positions too. The reason for his sudden resignation could not be ascertained.

Jagannathan is credited with having built Star Health as a strong brand in the health insurance space and has also made it a profitable venture at a time when health insurers struggle to generate profits.

A veteran of the insurance industry with over five decades of experience, Jagannathan served as the Chairman and Managing Director of PSU general insurance firm United India Insurance before founding Star Health.

In FY23, Star Health achieved an underwriting profit of ₹204 crore with a combined ratio of 95.3 per cent and an overall profit after tax of ₹619 crore, which is the highest in its history. It has a strong presence in the retail health segment, with a market share of about 34 per cent. It has an agency force of more than 6.25 lakh.

During the first two months of this fiscal, Star Health reported a gross direct premium underwritten of ₹1,821 crore and a garnered market share of 4.16 per cent in the overall non-life space. The stand-alone health insurer’s market share is higher than that of several non-life players."

480	STARHEALTH	Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Ltd	Star Health founder Venkatasamy Jagannathan resigns from company’s board	"

For the 79-year-old industry veteran, this is not the first retirement in his 53-year stellar career. Before Star Health, he had scripted a real turnaround saga with state-run United India Insurance Company (United India). When he took over as chairman and managing director (CMD) of United India in 2001, the company was ratcheting up losses of Rs 50 lakh. When he retired in October 2004, it chalked up a profit of over Rs 400 crore. In May 2006, when Venkatasamy Jagannathan started Star Health and Allied Insurance Company (Star Health), he and his 12 employees were sitting in a dingy room on Madha Church Road in Chennai with a monthly rent of about Rs 30,000. On Saturday, when he resigned as the non-executive chairman and director, the market capitalisation of Star Health was close to Rs 30,100 crore with over 14,000 employees, scripting an unparalleled growth story for the country’s first standalone health insurance company.



“For men may come and men may go, but our company will go forever,” he says, borrowing the lines from Lord Tennyson’s The Brook to mean that this was the belief he infused into his employees at United India and at Star Health. Ensconced in his home in Poes Garden, Jagannathan turns philosophical when asked about his future and of Star Health’s.



It was after his retirement that he joined hands with ETA Star Group to start Star Health. Jagannathan started his career at Hercules Insurance Company on June 3, 1970, and became an administrative officer with United India during Nationalisation. In his sure-footed pursuit of success, he slowly climbed up the rungs of the ladder to become CMD of the company one day.

To save money, he had to lease typewriters. For the first two years, people looked at the venture with trepidation of failure. However, getting two government health insurance programmes, first in Andhra Pradesh and then in Tamil Nadu, turned out to be a game changer for the company, following which people started reposing trust in Star Health. “In the public sector, we had an established office. Here, I had to start from A to Z. We entered health because I thought the middle-income group needed financial wherewithal,” he says.



Jagannathan recalls how he ensured branch managers were hired from their respective areas and how the founder would field customer calls, often at midnight. The company created a team of doctors to look into every minutiae of every bill. Today, it has 400 doctors and is credited with having one of the largest health insurance hospital networks in India, encompassing 13,000 hospitals.



Looking at the Star Health numbers, nearly 39 per cent of its revenue was derived from South India, 23 per cent from West India, 30 per cent from North India, and 8 per cent from East India. When asked about the highest point of his career, Jagannathan calls attention to the company’s 2022–23 performance. The company clocked a profit of Rs 618 crore and an underwriting profit of Rs 204 crore, helping him to hang up his boots and post the highest-ever profit and the best industry numbers.



Jagannathan is credited with starting lunch for Star Health employees and even offering employee stock ownership plans (ESOPS) at the branch manager level, going against the grain of companies restricting ESOPs to senior-level executives only. When asked about East India’s lower share, he says the insurance-conservative East market is one of the fast-evolving areas that the new leaders will have to tap into.



Although he resigned from the post of CMD in May this year, he continued as non-executive chairman and director. However, the industry veteran is holding his cards close to his chest as far as retirement plans go, saying he is weighing up all fields for his comeback. “A leader must know his men. A General must know his soldiers,” he adds, as a hark back to Sun Tzu.

“Every beginning has an end and every end has a new beginning. I am also searching,” he signs off sagely.

491	DELHIVERY	Delhivery Ltd	NCLT sends notice to Go First IRP over Delhivery’s plea citing its insolvency process as ‘fraudulent’	"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has issued a notice to the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) of crisis-hit Go First over a plea filed by supply chain operator Delhivery.

The Delhivery had moved the tribunal on Thursday and said the debt-ridden airline intentionally took payments from them despite knowing that it was filing for voluntary insolvency.

The tribunal admitted Delhivery's notice and gave Go First’s interim resolution professional of the Wadia-group airline, Abhilash Lal, two weeks to reply.

In its application, the logistics company said that the airline received over Rs 1.58 crore from them for delivering domestic cargo consignment but never acted on it.

""Go First received Rs 57 lakh on May 2 from Delhivery as advance for future services, knowing fully well they were filing for insolvency,"" said the counsel for Delhivery. On May 2, the airline had filed for insolvency with the tribunal.

Under Section 65 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, fraudulent and malicious initiation of insolvency proceedings can invite a penalty of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

A two-member bench of the NCLT directed the IRP to file a reply within two weeks and listed the matter on July 24 for the next hearing.

Go First is presently going through Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). In its insolvency application, the crisis-hit airline said it was “forced” to apply for resolution and protection under Section 10 of IBC due to the ever-increasing failure of Pratt and Whitney engines that power its fleet.

In its bankruptcy filing to NCLT, Go First said it owes Rs 6,521 crore ($797.38 million) in total to Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, and Deutsche Bank, which are its financial creditors.

The airline has further said it has a total liability of about Rs 11,463 crore to banks, other creditors, vendors, and others.

The NCLT on May 10 admitted the plea of Go First to initiate voluntary insolvency resolution proceedings and appointed Lal of Alvarez & Marsal as IRP of the airline.

Earlier this week, the tribunal directed Lal to file a reply within one week over the petitions filed by three lessors -- BOC Aviation (Ireland), Jackson Square Aviation Ireland and Engine Lease Finance BV -- seeking possession of their aircraft and engines.

The lessors contended that they had terminated their lease before the airline's insolvency plea was admitted.
