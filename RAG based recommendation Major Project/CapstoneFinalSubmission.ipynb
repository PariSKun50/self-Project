efficiency improved. reducing eliminating axial thrust also reduce engine wear. example, angular momentum axial counterbalance offset axial force rotor turbopump (e.g., shaft one component attached thereto interacting therewith), reduces eliminates axial force exerted component turbopump. axial counterbalance offset larger range axial force coupling ability rotational speed (e.g., rotation per minute, rpms) shaft. increase rpms increase angular momentum axial counterbalance. increase angular momentum used offset (i.e., reduce eliminate) increasing larger axial forces. disclosed axial

rocket engine propulsion system includes an axial counterbalance to reduce or eliminate axial thrust exerted on components of a turbopump. the axial counterbalance can allow for a larger range of axial thrust forces while coupling this ability to a rotational speed (e.g., rotations per minute, or rpm) of a shaft. the axial counterbalance includes a rack and pinion system in which the rack can be teeth extending circumferentially around a shaft and the pinon can be teeth extending outwardly from a swing arm perpendicular to the shaft. the swing arm is rotatably attached to a bracket which is constrained by a static support. the swing arm can also include a weight on an end of the swing arm opposite the end of the swing arm including the pinion., description_text: detailed description
