3	ADANIGREEN	Adani Green Energy Ltd	Adani Green Energy to meet in June to approve raising $750-850 m	"Adani Green Energy’s board is expected to meet next month to approve a share sale to raise between $750-850 million, taking the total proposed fundraising by the group to about $3.4 billion.

Two other group companies — Adani Transmission and Adani Enterprises — have already obtained board approval to raise ₹21,000 crore (roughly $2.5 billion) through qualified institutional placements. The meeting for shareholders’ approval is scheduled for the middle of June, after which the fundraising will take place.

The board of Adani Green was scheduled to meet last week but it was cancelled owing to the non-availability of independent directors.

Big fundraises

This is the second big fundraising exercise by the group after the damaging allegations by short seller hedge fund Hindenburg Research, that led to Adani Enterprises having to scrap its ₹20,000-crore follow-on public offer in February with retail investors staying away from subscribing to it.

Subsequently in March, the group, in firefighting mode and in dire need of funds, sold small chunks of promoter stake in four group companies to US-based growth equity fund GQG Partners to raise over ₹15,000 crore. Reports have suggested that GQG Partners has pumped in about $500 million more in acquiring shares in Adani stocks recently, but it was not clear whether these were secondary market purchases.

With a debt burden in excess of $20 billion, maturing debt to be serviced stretching over the next several years and expansion plans already charted out, the group needs funds on several counts.

Stronger position

Financially and in terms of perception, the group is in a stronger position now than it was previously with all the companies in the group showing healthy growth. It has managed to repay short-term, high-cost debt while also reducing pledged promoter stake in group companies.

It is investing in new energies and building a large-scale solar generation capacity in the country. Its intention is to be the largest player in the infrastructure sector after the government. It is working towards getting its group companies to a stage where there is little day-to-day strategic input from promoters. The ports and power businesses are expected to get there soon."

10	ABBOTINDIA	Abbott India Ltd	To Help Women With Endometriosis, Experts Give Nod to Abbott’s Tweaked Drug Trial	"Aiming to improve the quality of life of women suffering from endometriosis-related chronic pain, India has given the nod to American drug giant Abbott for conducting phase 3 clinical trials for the tweaked version of ‘dydrogesterone’, News18 has learnt.

The drug trial aims to study the management of endometriosis-related pelvic pain.

India will be the first country to conduct the trials. Currently, the drug is not approved in India or in any other country across the globe.

Close to 2.5 crore Indian women suffer from endometriosis, which impacts their everyday lifestyle. Every four of 100 women suffer from the painful disorder in which tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, in places including the abdomen and pelvic area.

The subject expert committee (SEC), in its meeting on May 25, recommended grant of permission to conduct the Phase III clinical trial and bioequivalence. However, the panel of experts has asked the company to “include more clinical trial sites and the sites should be geographically distributed across the country,” according to the minutes of the meeting, seen by News18.

The committee also suggested that the firm should monitor the size of endometrioma of participating subjects during the clinical trial.

On May 18, Abbott submitted an application to the office of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) — the apex health regulator — seeking permission for the manufacturing and marketing of “dydrogesterone modified release tablets 20 milligrams"".

At present, dydrogesterone tablets (10 mg) are available in India in “immediate release"" (IR) format for the indications of progesterone deficiencies, such as the treatment of endometriosis, dysmenorrhoea and secondary amenorrhoea, irregular cycles and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

It is also used in the treatment of threatened miscarriage and habitual miscarriage apart from hormone replacement therapy.

How will the trial be conducted?

The protocol submitted by the firm, seen by News18, aims to enrol around 230 subjects (115 in each arm) in this study.

“This is a prospective, randomised, single-blind, single-dummy, non-inferiority, two-arm, multicentric study,” said the trial protocol. “Subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive either Dydrogesterone modified release tablet 20 mg OD or Dydrogesterone 10 mg IR.”

The treatment duration — under the study —for each subject will be three months. The study will enrol women aged between 18 and 45 years who have been diagnosed with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.

“The subjects would be provided with patient diaries where they would note details about their daily intake of study drug, any concomitant medications that they take including analgesics, and any treatment emergent adverse events they experience.”

The company has proposed to manufacture the tweaked formulation at the Puducherry-based loan-licensed manufacturing site of Abbott India Ltd.

In the trial protocol, the secondary objective behind the study is to assess the quality of life in subjects with endometriosis treated with dydrogesterone ‘modified’ versus ‘immediate release’ apart from the additional objective of assessing the reduction in the size of endometriosis with both medicines."

The Nifty ended the lacklustre week marginally in the green and importantly a tad above the psychological 18,500 mark. The way markets took a leap at the opening last Monday, we expected the broader benchmark to challenge 18,700. So, it was certainly a disappointing behaviour of major indices as the week progressed.

Technically speaking, the upside gap area has been filled and Nifty has retested the breakout points twice during the week. In addition, due to Friday’s price action, the ‘Inside Bar’ candle is clearly visible on the daily time frame chart.

Going ahead, if global markets support, we can construe last week’s price development as a pullback and from here on, we may see the Nifty resuming its upwards trajectory in the current week. This view remains valid as long as cluster of support around 18,460 – 18,400 – 18,330 is not violated on a closing basis in the next couple of sessions.

On the flipside, the sturdy wall is visible around 18,600 – 18,670 and the moment it’s surpassed, we may see all-time high getting challenged soon. This seems possible considering the buoyancy in the broader market. The Mid and Small cap baskets remained active throughout last week, indicating improved sentiments in the market.

Hence, we advise traders not to get carried away by such small declines. Broadly, we are in a strong uptrend and it’s advisable to focus on the larger picture.

Here are two buy calls for the short term:

HUDCO: Buy | LTP: Rs 61.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 57.80 | Target: Rs 68 | Return: 11 percent

Housing & Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) has witnessed strong moves in the last couple of trading sessions which were backed by robust volumes. The recent price-volume action construes a positive development in the chart structure as it clocked a new 52-week high.

Also, on the momentum oscillator front, we witnessed a positive crossover in the RSI (relative strength index), which may provide the much-needed impetus for the next leg of the rally.

Based on the above evidences, we recommend buying for a trading target of Rs 68. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 57.80.

Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,967.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,820 | Target: Rs 5,250 | Return: 6 percent

Recently, the entire Healthcare space has been buzzing and seems to be finding its mojo back. Along with pharmaceutical companies, ‘Apollo Hospitals’ too performed well throughout this week.

On Friday, we finally witnessed a massive breakout from the 15-month long ‘Ascending Triangle’ pattern on the daily chart. If we look at the volume activity, it has been rising continuously in the recent run.

The stock is now well poised for a much stronger move in the longer horizon. However, in the near term, we expect the stock to move towards Rs 5,250. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 4,820.

18	AUROPHARMA	Aurobindo Pharma Ltd	Aurobindo Pharma’s Reddy turns approver in Delhi excise case	"Aurobindo Pharma Director Sarath P Reddy has turned approver after a Rouse Avenue court on Thursday accepted Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea to pardon him in the Delhi excise case. ED argued that the Hyderabad-based businessman will voluntarily offer full disclosure of irregularities committed in framing and executing of the liquor policy allegedly tinkered to favour a few entities and politicians.

Rouse Avenue Court’s Special Judge MK Nagpal allowed Reddy to turn approver in the case, which the agency believed would help them in getting into the bottom of the scam. Reddy was allegedly key to “South Group” that had paid ₹100 crore to AAP, which was used to fund its Goa elections.

Like the other accused including former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, he was also accused of destroying digital evidence, such as those available on mobile phones, to scuttle the probe against him, the ED had earlier alleged.

20	AUBANK	AU Small Finance Bank Ltd	AU Bank enters Jefferies India portfolio, CAMS exits; Here’s why Chris Wood is taking contra bets?	"Chris Wood, the Global Head of Equity Strategy of Jefferies, has added AU Small Finance Bank to his India portfolio, with a 3 per cent weightage. Just a week earlier, the global stock guru had added food delivery platform Zomato to his India portfolio with a 4 per cent weight.



AU Small Finance Bank will be part of GREED & Fear's long-only India portfolio. He has replaced the private lender by slashing the investment in Computer Age Management Services (CAMS). Subsequently, the lending sector has a total weightage of 35 per cent in Wood's portfolio after the addition of AU Small Finance Bank.



Shares of CAMS dropped about 2 per cent to Rs 2198.15 on Friday, while AU Small Finance Bank was trading about 2 per cent up at Rs 778.85 during the session.



AU Small Finance Bank stock has delivered healthy returns of over 40 per cent over the past two months, but we see a robust growth opportunity for the bank in the long term and believe the stock can be a compounder if the bank continues to execute well, near-term growth opportunities are fairly priced in after the recent outperformance, said Motilal Oswal.



""Loan growth is likely to remain steady. While the management has shown strong execution prowess and we believe the long-term growth story remains intact, we find the current risk-reward unattractive after the recent stock performance. We, thus, downgrade the rating to Neutral with a target price of Rs 830,"" it added.



HDFC Securities and Dalal & Broacha had 'sell' ratings on AU Small Finance Bank in April after its Q4 earnings with a target price of Rs 580 and Rs 569, respectively. However, Axis Securities and ICICI Securities have 'buy' ratings on the stock but their targets have been met since.



GREED & Fear observed that banks and finance companies, known as the lending sectors, account for nearly 36 per cent of the Nifty 50 index, compared to 24 percent for the MSCI India index.



""This means that from the standpoint of domestic fund managers who measure their performance against the Nifty, GREED & fear is underweight the lending sectors in long-only India portfolio, even though it is overweight in the Asia ex-Japan and global long-only portfolio,"" the note said.



The 'long' portfolio means shares with buy recommendations, while the 'short' portfolio is for selling the shares and buying them later, on corrections, to make profits.



India's lending sector accounts for 32 per cent of the India long-only portfolio, 19 per cent of the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio and 14 per cent of the global portfolio of Jefferies.



Wood had earlier highlighted that India's asset management story is the most promising domestic asset management story globally. However, removing Computer Age Management Services within a few days after this came as a shocker to the markets.



""It might seem odd to remove CAMS which is a long-term play on the development of the asset management industry,"" he said. Still, GREED & Fear has discovered this week that the mutual fund industry faces regulatory headwinds which, if implemented, will increasingly damage the profits of what is a clear success story, he added.



ICICI Securities and Motilal Oswal had a 'buy' rating on Computer Age Management Services in early May with a target price of Rs 2,413 and Rs 2,600, respectively. However, HDFC Securities had suggested 'reducing' the stock with a target price of Rs 2,000 on it.

21	ASHOKLEY	Ashok Leyland Ltd	Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland: Auto stocks that analysts like post May sales data	"Auto wholesale volumes for May came in steady, with a sequential recovery witnessed across segments. Analysts said rural demand recovery was visible with motorcycle sales growth coming in ahead of scooter sales growth on month-on-month (MoM) basis. Export too staged a comeback and was up on MoM basis for most of the OEMs, they said.

ICICIdirect said Hero MotoCorp led the growth in the two-wheeler segment, Maruti Suzuki in personal vehicle (PV) space, Tata Motors in commercial vehicle (CV) sales and Escorts in the tractor segment. Analysts largely positive on shares of Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.

May sales data

Among automakers, Maruti Suzuki’s volumes for the month stood at 1.8 lakh units, up 10.9 per cent MoM. Tata Motors' total sales came in at 74,973 units, up 7.7 per cent MoM. Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive segment volumes de-grew 1.4 per cent MoM to 61,415 units. For Ashok Leyland, volumes were up 1.2 per cent MoM at 13,134 units and was led by M&HCV segment.

Among two-wheeler makers, Hero MotoCorp led the volume recovery with total volumes rising 31 per cent MoM to 5.2 lakh units. Bajaj Auto's volumes were up 7.2 per cent MoM at 3.6 lakh units. Domestic sales were up 7.1 per cent while exports logged 7.3 per cent growth for Bajaj Auto. TVS Motors’ two-wheeler sales were up 8.3 per cent MoM to 3.2 lakh units. its three-wheeler sales were broadly flat MoM.

ICICIdirect said chip supplies continue to limit the production ramp-up in the PV segment despite healthy order-book across. In the CV space, growth at the industry leader was encouraging amid guidance for YoY decline in Q1FY24 tracking high base of last year & pre-buying witnessed in Q4FY23. In the tractor space, numbers were a mixed bag amid guidance of low single digit growth in FY24E.

Auto stocks that analysts like

Within OEMs, Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto. It said industry wholesale volumes for PV segment were ahead of its estimates while medium-heavy commercial vehicles and two-wheeler wholesales were largely in-line.

Motilal Oswal Securities said it prefers CVs over other segments, considering strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We prefer companies with: higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, encouraging margin drivers, and a strong balance sheet. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the broker's top OEM picks.

Anand Rathi has retained its optimistic view on the auto sector and suggested Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp as its preferred picks.

""In PV segment, wholesales in near-term are likely to be a function of further normalisation of supplies and response to recent model launches. Two-wheeler demand remains contingent on rural sentiments. Steady freight rates are supporting CV operators. Rising interest rates, however, remains a key deterrent. We expect CV volumes to be supported by demand from infra & construction sectors,"" JM Financial said.

So it is not that the brokerages can turn rogue and run away with your money. So to that extent, there is very little to distinguish from one broker to the other. So I do not like brokerage stocks because I do not think they have any real moat going for them. I am not looking to invest in these sectors at all,"" says Sandip Sabharwal , asksandipsabharwal.com.Both of them are suffering from a sort of profitability squeeze. Margins are coming down despite the business growing and the squeeze in margins is such that the growth cannot compensate for it. So I think that is the challenge which brokerages as well as AMCs are facing. Most of the AMC products have been typically underperformers and that is also leading to investors moving out and looking at other avenues. So they are incrementally losing market share although the SIP inflows continue to be strong.From the brokerage's perspective, there is very little to distinguish one from the other. Everyone is just going for the lowest brokerage, given the fact that new SEBI regulations, your funds, etc. are relatively safe. So it is not that the brokerages can turn rogue and run away with your money. So to that extent, there is very little to distinguish from one broker to the other. So I do not like brokerage stocks because I do not think they have any real moat going for them. I am not looking to invest in these sectors at all.I think so. I think it is reasonably priced. It had a run up above 900. Then there were some disappointing result prints as well as the news flow from the US related to Class 8 truck orders, which has incrementally a lesser play these days for Bharat Forge but that is what somehow the analysts in the market seem to be tracking.So I think it is reasonably priced. It needs some trigger for it to perform as in from some good quarterly result, etc. But strategically, what the company is doing in terms of diversification into various other spaces like defence or aerospace or other industries, I think that will bear fruit going forward. I would think that it should be a decent play at the current prices.Worst in terms of performance, yes, one could say that the kind of losses they were making, I think the losses will come down but does that create an opportunity for investors to make a sustainable play? It is still doubtful because of their business models. For example, Paytm, if you see the entire improvement in profitability or whatever they are talking of is coming from their loan origination where they earn commissions on originating loans. That is not a high PE business because it is just like a commission agent working like a commission agent. So I do not see these companies getting built in a manner where one can say that they will have some sort of moat for years to come. I would be sceptical buying into these companies.I think it is going to be a challenging time for them, especially given the fact that if you look at where the steel cycle is going, steel prices in China are back to 2022 lows after rallying more than 20% from there. That will put pressure on global, all the incremental sort of ancillary industries and we could also see production cuts etc. coming up. So I do not think there is any big story in these stocks at this stage.Yes, I think niche consumption will do well. Unfortunately, most of it tends to be in global brands and to that extent what we are seeing is premium global brands on the consumption space are doing much better now in India than some of the medium to lower priced products.But I think giving specific example that the stage is tough, so I think from the companies which recently listed maybe something like a Vedant Fashion could be a gainer in this but there also the valuation at this stage seems to be a bit excessive.Sula Vineyard etc. although the wine consumption is growing but if you look at the pace of their growth etc I think it is not so exciting that we give very high PEs to that.Cement is an intriguing space at this stage because on one hand we are seeing that the cement companies are unable to pass on price hikes. So they try but the prices come back because supply is so strong. On the other hand we have got good demand trends and a complete collapse of sort of input cost pressures and which will aid their profitability. And that is the reason why the stocks have also gone up so much. It is a very tough sector to call frankly. So there are tailwinds which at this stage look better than the fact that they are unable to increase prices. So I would say that people can buy these stocks but I think at somewhat lower valuations."

26	BAJAJ-AUTO	Bajaj Auto Ltd	Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland: Auto stocks that analysts like post May sales data	"Auto wholesale volumes for May came in steady, with a sequential recovery witnessed across segments. Analysts said rural demand recovery was visible with motorcycle sales growth coming in ahead of scooter sales growth on month-on-month (MoM) basis. Export too staged a comeback and was up on MoM basis for most of the OEMs, they said.

ICICIdirect said Hero MotoCorp led the growth in the two-wheeler segment, Maruti Suzuki in personal vehicle (PV) space, Tata Motors in commercial vehicle (CV) sales and Escorts in the tractor segment. Analysts largely positive on shares of Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.

May sales data

Among automakers, Maruti Suzuki’s volumes for the month stood at 1.8 lakh units, up 10.9 per cent MoM. Tata Motors' total sales came in at 74,973 units, up 7.7 per cent MoM. Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive segment volumes de-grew 1.4 per cent MoM to 61,415 units. For Ashok Leyland, volumes were up 1.2 per cent MoM at 13,134 units and was led by M&HCV segment.

Among two-wheeler makers, Hero MotoCorp led the volume recovery with total volumes rising 31 per cent MoM to 5.2 lakh units. Bajaj Auto's volumes were up 7.2 per cent MoM at 3.6 lakh units. Domestic sales were up 7.1 per cent while exports logged 7.3 per cent growth for Bajaj Auto. TVS Motors’ two-wheeler sales were up 8.3 per cent MoM to 3.2 lakh units. its three-wheeler sales were broadly flat MoM.

ICICIdirect said chip supplies continue to limit the production ramp-up in the PV segment despite healthy order-book across. In the CV space, growth at the industry leader was encouraging amid guidance for YoY decline in Q1FY24 tracking high base of last year & pre-buying witnessed in Q4FY23. In the tractor space, numbers were a mixed bag amid guidance of low single digit growth in FY24E.

Auto stocks that analysts like

Within OEMs, Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto. It said industry wholesale volumes for PV segment were ahead of its estimates while medium-heavy commercial vehicles and two-wheeler wholesales were largely in-line.

Motilal Oswal Securities said it prefers CVs over other segments, considering strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We prefer companies with: higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, encouraging margin drivers, and a strong balance sheet. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the broker's top OEM picks.

Anand Rathi has retained its optimistic view on the auto sector and suggested Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp as its preferred picks.

""In PV segment, wholesales in near-term are likely to be a function of further normalisation of supplies and response to recent model launches. Two-wheeler demand remains contingent on rural sentiments. Steady freight rates are supporting CV operators. Rising interest rates, however, remains a key deterrent. We expect CV volumes to be supported by demand from infra & construction sectors,"" JM Financial said.

The domestic sales were up over twofold on year to 2,28,401 units versus 1,12,308 units in the year ago period. This increase is remarkable, especially given the fact that the company has been struggling with sluggish domestic demand, primarily in rural areas in the recent quarters.

During an interview with CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma, the Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, highlighted that the domestic segment exhibited robust performance, largely attributed to the exceptional performance within the 125cc segment.

The benefit of a decline in freight cost and partial clearance of high raw material inventory supported the operating performance in Q4FY23. A significant improvement would be led more by the volume uptick than a correction in input cost as the partial pass on cost benefits in a competitive market cannot be ruled out.

29	BANKINDIA	Bank of India Ltd	Life certificate submission at any branch, online deposit claim settlement: RBI committee’s major recommends	"The Reserve Bank may consider progressively moving towards “principle-based” regulation with regard to customer service in the REs. These may be based on well - recognised customer - friendly principles, including, but not limited to, Equitable and Fair Treatment, Transparency and Disclosures, Appropriateness and Suitability, Data Protection / Customer Confidentiality, Right to Grievance Redress, etc.

The Reserve Bank may put in place a suitable structure of incentives and disincentives to encourage REs to take proactive steps towards enterprise-wide improvements in customer service and impart systemic strength to overall customer protection efforts in the financial sector while imposing a regulatory cost for entities where the quality of customer service is deficient.

The Reserve Bank may consider making the Charter of Customer Rights enforceable after reviewing and updating it. The Reserve Bank may consider extending the Charter to Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) also.

The customer service regulation should be consolidated on the principle of same activity same regulation and apply to all the REs depending upon the activity being undertaken by them, irrespective of the category of the Res.

With a view to ensure that there is uniformity in classifying, recording and reporting of complaints by the REs, the Reserve Bank should lay down a definition of a complaint under the IGR mechanism which should also capture the complaints which are outside the purview of RB-IOS. An indicative definition could be: “Any reference received formally through electronic or paper mode flagging a “deficiency in service”, as defined in RB-IOS, pertaining to all the activities which the RE undertakes and services it offers.”

The RBI Ombudsmen (RBIOs) should be empowered, based on the facts or a set of similar complaints, to direct the RE concerned to review and undertake suitable corrective action in all such cases and confirm compliance to the Reserve Bank. Being the focal department for Customer Service, Consumer Education and Protection Department (CEPD), may also be empowered to direct all REs to initiate corrective action in such cases, if the deficiency in service, in its view, is widely prevalent.

The Reserve Bank may develop and publish a “Customer Service and Protection Index” with a view to capture, at the system level, the quality / standards of customer service and extent of customer protection in the REs through a single score. The Index may cover dimensions like adequacy of regulatory and institutional framework in place, customer experience, efficacy of grievance redress, under both IGR and AGR, extent of customer education and awareness, etc.

The Reserve Bank should assess the quality of customer service through periodic and regular thematic studies across the REs to ensure better compliance to the customer service guidelines. The findings should feed suitably into the framework to improve IGR and the proposed ratings of Res

The Reserve Bank, during the supervisory process, should take a view on the reasonableness of charges levied by REs for the services offered

In order to address the conflict of interests, and to increase the effectiveness of the Internal Ombudsmen (IO) appointed in the REs, the Reserve Bank may nudge the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) to create a fund to directly pay the salary / compensation to the IOs of the banks. Similar funds can be created by respective Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for other categories of REs. Alternatively, the Reserve Bank itself may consider creating the fund. Cost of the above fund, thus created, may be recovered from the REs, in proportion to the complaints against them referred to the Ios.

An RE - agnostic common portal for lodging complaints may be set up by the Reserve Bank so that the customers of any RE can lodge complaints on a single 14.The portal may allocate the complaints to respective REs, enable facility for tracking of the complaints by the complainant and for automatic escalation of rejected complaints to the IOs. Going forward, the Reserve Bank may also consider integrating this platform with its Complaint Management System (CMS) portal to provide for seamless transfer and movement of complaints and data.

Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) may update its Model Operating Procedure (MOP), in line with regulation, for hassle-free settlement of claims in accounts of the deceased account holders, in various scenarios. The MOP may provide for the documents required to be submitted by the claimant. In case nomination exists, the proceeds may be released immediately, upon submission of the required documents.

Obtaining nomination in deposit accounts may be made mandatory to facilitate hassle-free settlement of claims in case of death of the account holder. Several existing accounts do not have nominations at present. The REs should be asked to obtain nominations in all such cases within a reasonable time period, say three years.

To obviate the need for visits to the branches / RE premises, by the nominee / heirs, the process for settling deceased claims may also be made available on-line. The on-line facility may provide for submission of all the required documents and their verification. A system of generating digital reference number upon submission of the claim and supportive documents may be made available. The claims may be settled within a reasonable time period, say 30 days from the date of submission of all necessary documents. The timeframe should also apply when the claims are physically submitted. Beyond 30 days, the REs may be required to pay interest at a rate, say two percent higher than the rate at which the deceased person’s deposit was held.

While the REs should take necessary steps to periodically update KYC, it must be ensured that operations in the account are not stopped.

The RE should maintain a centralised database of Know Your Customer (KYC) documents of all customers, linked to a unique customer identifier, say the Customer Information File (CIF), obviating the need for submitting KYC documents repeatedly for availing multiple facilities from the same RE. Whenever KYC documents are updated by the customer, the same should be reflected for all other facilities availed by the customer from the RE.

The REs may adopt a nuanced approach for risk categorization of the customers. For example, salary earners with inflows and outflows consistent with the customer’s profile need not necessarily be categorised as high risk, even though they may be “high net worth” individuals. Similarly, students can also be categorized as low - risk.

The responsibility for obtaining and renewing the insurance of the primary asset may be an unequivocal responsibility of one of the parties to the agreement, viz., the borrower or the RE, and clearly indicated in the Key Facts Statement / Most Important Terms and Conditions document.

The Reserve Bank may consider stipulating a time limit for the REs to return the property documents to the borrower from the date of closure of the loan account, failing which a penalty / compensation linked to the extent of delay should automatically be paid by the RE to the borrower

In case of loss of property documents, the RE should not only be obligated to assist in obtaining certified registered copies of documents at their cost but also compensate the customer adequately, keeping in view the time taken to arrange the alternate copies of the documents

REs may provide an option for the relatives of the senior citizens to pay upfront for the door-step services as well as other such conveniences, if any, to be availed by their elders

The pensioners should be able to submit Life Certificate (LC) at any branch of the bank in which they maintain their pension account. Moreover, they should be allowed to submit LC in any month of their choice to avoid rush in a particular month. Subsequent LCs can be submitted in the same month at annual intervals

Compensating the customer in case of any injury suffered while availing services at the premises of the RE, due to inadequate / faulty infrastructure, and bearing the medical expenses, if any, should be a part of customer policy of the RE. The REs should take adequate insurance cover for such eventualities, and the customer and staff should be made aware of the same.

Cross selling of third - party products by the sales team of the RE should be subject to verification by the audit function to ensure that there was no mis-selling and all instructions / guidelines with respect to sale of such products were adhered to.

Till the recommendation for a common complaint portal is put in place, the REs should have a system to enable the complainant to track the progress in processing of the complaint. The expected time for resolution of the complaint should invariably be communicated to the complainant. If the Turn Around Time (TAT) for resolution is exceeded, the same should be communicated to the complainant, indicating reasons for the delay.

Customer-facing staff and officers should undergo mandatory training in soft skills to reduce instances of misbehaviour by the errant staff / officers. Adequate knowledge and in-depth understanding of the internal guidelines and the regulatory instructions must be an essential requirement for posting employees in IGR-related positions.

Video based Customer Identification Process (V - CIP), an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence by an authorised official of the RE by undertaking seamless, secure, live, informed-consent based audio-visual interaction with the customer to obtain identification information required for Customer Due Diligence (CDD) purpose, may be increasingly used

There is a need for standardisation of ATM interface and ensure a minimum set of functionalities at the ATM by all banks / White Label ATM (WLA) operators. For meeting the needs of physically challenged, senior citizens and those who are not tech-savvy, etc., extra care may be provided by deploying ‘text to speech’ software, ChatBots, multi-language supporting software.

Proper messages should be displayed in respect of unsuccessful ATM transactions, so that the customer can identify the exact reason why she is not able to undertake transaction / ascertain the status of the transaction.

REs may design and deploy safer means of second factor authentication. In this regard, biometric sensors on smartphones such as face / fingerprint / iris scanners can replace physical signatures to make physical presence no longer obligatory. Such integration can also help senior citizens avail banking services with greater ease. Further, such phone-based scanners can augment the OTP based authentication system as an additional factor of authentication and help in reducing frauds.

4.3.8 REs may provide alerts to customers during “teachable moments”. For example, warnings against sharing of credentials.

On-line facility be made available on the Indian Cybercrime Reporting Portal for registering complaints by members of public in respect of fraudulent transactions. The complaint should trigger an automated alert mail from the victim’s bank to beneficiary bank / card issuer / merchants for blocking the flow of funds. The beneficiary bank should immediately block equivalent amount in the account till detailed verification of the reported transaction in the complaint is completed. In case of merchants, sale /dispatch of merchandise should be kept on hold. All these may be implemented as STP, to the extent possible.

The Call Centre of REs may be designed with a dedicated IVRS flow, sharing the important ‘do’s and don’ts’ with the customer, based on the customer profile /queries, including provision of in-house financial advisors for complex queries or sophisticated customers. An automated call back feature in Call Centre, when a call is dropped mid-way, need to be provided. Option to speak to the customer care executive should be part of all menu options.

Last year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had formed a committee to examine the customer services provided by RBI-regulated entities (RE) such as banks, non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), and payment service operators.This Committee's mission was to monitor and review the quality of customer service, examine changing demands, identify best practices, and propose actions to improve the quality of customer service and the grievance resolution system in the REs, the RBI said in a press release issued on June 5, 2023. After significant deliberation with varied stakeholders, the Committee delivered its report on June 5. One of the recommendations is to make the Charter of Customer Rights enforceable after reviewing and updating it. Obtaining nomination in deposit accounts may be made mandatory to facilitate hassle-free settlement of claims in case of death of the account holder, is another recommendation. In case of loss of property documents, the regulated entity, should not only be obligated to assist in obtaining certified registered copies of documents at their cost but also compensate the customer adequately.Here are the major recommendations made by the RBI's Committee for Review of Customer Service Standards in RBI Regulated Entities (REs)."	"The Reserve Bank may consider progressively moving towards “principle-based” regulation with regard to customer service in the REs.
The Reserve Bank may consider making the Charter of Customer Rights enforceable after reviewing and updating it.

29	BANKINDIA	Bank of India Ltd	Private capex, durable retail consumption hinge on rates heading south	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had trailed the US Federal Reserve by about three months in stepping up rates last summer. Will Mumbai now beat Washington in running the reverse course on interest rates?Ahead of the meetings of the two rate-setting central banks panels over this week and the next, odds are lengthening the Fed will get to cut rates at all in 2023. Persistently high prices and a job market generating mixed signals on wages and additions to rolls have seemingly bumped up the interest-rate cruising altitude for US policymakers.Last Friday’s jobs data, for instance, threw up major surprises. At nearly 340,000, US job additions in May were nearly 70% higher than what economists had predicted. Of course, jobs data are gathered from surveying businesses, while data for the unemployment gauge that inched up about 30 basis points to 3.7% are garnered by querying households.One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.From the rate standpoint, the only actionable piece of statistics may have been the relatively marginal delta in average hourly wages. That would, in all probability, obviate the need for an immediate increase in the benchmark US rates next week.Still, the odds have risen on a rate reduction in the US this year. Even as late as mid-May, the Fed funds futures market pencilled in 75 basis points in total cuts, but now the markets expect only a 63% chance in rate reductions this year, Jefferies' Christopher Wood wrote in the latest edition of Greed & Fear published last week, referencing Bloomberg data.But that was before the May jobs data were published.There’s no gainsaying the fact that further increases in US interest rates will mount pressure on Mint Road to defer the start to its easing cycle to cushion the potential downside for the rupee, but as Wood says, domestic considerations could now have a disproportionate say on the policy approach in a nation that’s set for world-beating growth prospects.“The line from the RBI GREED and fear heard… is that the central bank will manage policy primarily around domestic factors,” Wood wrote. “If that policy is adhered to, then the central bank is likely to resist the pressure to raise rates, most particularly as India’s foreign exchange reserves are a not insignificant $593bn. It is also the case that with a growing amount of imported oil being purchased with rupees, the reserves are not being used up to the extent they would have been in the past.”Add to that India’s robust producer levy collections – consistently in excess of Rs 1.5 lakh crore a month – and a manufacturing purchasing managers’ index reading inching 59, and the stage seems set for a period of stable rates that can underpin private capital expenditure (capex) and sustained credit flow.That would essentially mean a reduction in benchmark rates, which have climbed 250 basis points in 11 months. With the producer price index now showing a negative reading in its latest print, most analysts are baking in a rate reduction sometime this year as the impact of input price inflation fades.That thought is evident in industry talk on private capital expenditure, which is likely to follow after the government took the lead in building assets so as to eventually “crowd in” private investment.On Monday, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) President R Dinesh told ET he expects a broad-based resurgence in private capital expenditure this fiscal year , with many in India Inc believing that the war against inflation has decisively been won by the RBI.That now puts the focus on a course reversal. “By October, we think there would be another opportunity for the RBI to decide whether it can take a different stance,” Dinesh was cited as saying in the ET report.Lower benchmark rates are key to bringing down the weighted average cost of capital for India Inc., and healthy bank balance sheets and rising levels of bank credit are expected to underpin capacity addition by corporate India where several industries are now reporting asset utilization north of 75%.One major pointer to the long-awaited turnaround in private-sector investment can be bank credit.“A sustained increase in credit may have lead information about investment demand pick-up, while an occasional rise may indicate demand for working capital , which could be for utilisation of current capacity,” the RBI’s annual report showed.The section of the report dwelling on the role of credit in driving private investment showed that non-food credit growth, as of March 2023, was robust at 15.4%, expanding in lockstep with the nominal GDP for the year.“The broad-based expansion in bank credit has been facilitated by healthier balance sheets of banks,” said the RBI annual report.The central bank did a study of the relationship between borrowings and fixed investments of listed non-financial firms for the decade to 2021, to assess whether the rise in bank credit could revive the investment cycle.“Results show that a one percentage point higher growth in bank borrowings increases nominal net fixed assets (NFA) by around 0.17 percentage points,” showed the RBI study.Since bank borrowings for the long term are typically contingent upon asset building, it shows that lower rates and absence of pricing pressures would drive private-sector capital expenditure.Will the RBI oblige?

31	BAJFINANCE	Bajaj Finance Ltd	Bajaj Finance may spin off its payments business into separate subsidiary	"Bajaj Finance is looking to spin off its payments vertical as a separate subsidiary, while in the next 3-5 years it is also expecting to meaningfully scale up platforms and apps launched in the past 4-5 years.

“We continue to invest in our payments business and are committed to delivering the entire stack of payments to our customers and merchant ecosystem. Payments business is an integral part of the company,” it added.

See clarification from Bajaj Finance at the end of the report

The non-banking finance company manages around half of all consumer loans in India in volume terms and has significant shares in loan volumes for the purchase of electronic items and iPhones.

Its mortgage book saw a growth of 26 per cent in the March quarter and constituted 28 per cent of its total assets under management, which was at ₹2.47 lakh crore at the end of March. Its payments business is still in the nascent stages and is being scaled up.

In a recent interaction at Jefferies India Forum, Bajaj Finance’s Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Jain indicated that the company is looking at a 4-5 per cent share in retail loans and a 3 per cent share in the payment segment.

New loan verticals

To make this happen the company is foraying into segments such as loans for automobiles, tractors, commercial vehicles, microfinance institutions, and emerging corporates. These are market segments with a potential combined opportunity of ₹13 lakh crore and they constitute roughly 28 per cent of retail credit in India. These are the new loan verticals that the company is expecting to drive growth in the medium to long term.

With a view to pushing its loan products, the company had launched a number of applications and platforms while also strengthening its branch network, all with a long-term horizon that will soon be paying off. The company’s strategy with its digital loan platforms has been to enhance its engagement with its existing customer base, rather than relying only on new customers. The app already has over 3.5 crore users with a significant download velocity. The improvement in operating efficiencies from this is expected to compensate for some compression in the net interest margins in the current year.

With its loan products, the company intends to strike a balance between secured and unsecured credit, those that are profit-maximisers and scale builders and new segments versus those that are part of its existing portfolio.

34	BRITANNIA	Britannia Industries Ltd	Mauritian Wadia group may play role in Go First saga	"New Delhi: A Mauritius-based Wadia group company that together with its affiliates indirectly holds a stake in Britannia Industries could take centre stage in a face-off between Go First 's bankers - some of whom want collateral provided by that company overseas for loans taken by the airline to be included in a common security pool, according to sources.The bankers' consortium of Go First that comprises public sector banks believes the collateral provided by Wadia group company, Mauritius-based Leila Lands Limited (LLL), for loans that Go First obtained from Deutsche Bank (DB) is disproportionately greater in value to the security that was provided to them for loans that they advanced to the airline, the sources said.Deutsche Bank has loaned money to Go First but is not part of the consortium.""We will move national company law tribunal ( NCLT ) to include the overseas security in the common pool. This is to ensure there is parity between lenders,"" a consortium banker told ET on condition of anonymity.ET had reported on May 12 that Leila Lands took loans worth $300 million from Deutsche Bank in financial year 2021 and 2022 by creating a charge on the bank account of London-based Associated Biscuits International Limited (ABIL), a company that owns 44.76% stake in the listed Britannia Industries.During the same period, Leila Lands created fixed deposits worth around $200 million to secure finance facilities from Deutsche Bank for Go First.""We cannot comment on speculation. No assets of the Wadia group companies were used to create any security taken from DB for GoFirst. As you are aware of the fact, as already replied to you on May 11, Leila Lands has provided security to Deutsche Bank by way of a fixed deposit of $191 million, out of its own accumulated retained cash earnings, to advance financial assistance to GoAir,"" said a representative of the Mauritius company.Leila Lands said the loan taken from Deutsche Bank was for its own corporate purposes and investments. ""A loan of $300 million has been provided by DB to LLL group for use in corporate purposes and investments. As is customary in loan financing, ABIL part of LLL group has provided a lien on its inflows. This has no connection whatsoever with its 44.76% shareholding stake in Britannia"".Britannia Industries and Go First did not respond to ET's queries. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.The public sector banks consortium that includes Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and IDBI Bank advanced loans to the airline by taking a land parcel owned by Wadia Realty as security. They may agree to bring that into the common security pool provided the entire security created in favour of Deutsche Bank is also brought into the pool. The trio have collectively loaned around Rs 3,400 crore to the airline. Deutsche Bank has loaned Rs 1,320 crore to the airline.""Deutsche Bank is not part of the consortium. The DB loan is a facility independent of the consortium with its own independent security,"" Leila Lands said.GoFirst was admitted for insolvency proceedings on May 10 by NCLT after it voluntarily approached the bankruptcy tribunal citing the commercial viability of its operations had been adversely impacted because several of its aircraft remained grounded due to defective engines supplied by Pratt & Whitney."

36	BHEL	Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd	BHEL shares up 60% in a year; can they revisit 52-week high levels?	"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) have surged more than 60 per cent in the past one year, outperforming the benchmark BSE Sensex's 13.32 per cent jump. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the climb has been limited. The stock has gained 2.35 per cent in 2023 so far, largely in line with a 2.94 per cent rise in Sensex.

The scrip on Tuesday settled 1.23 per cent lower at Rs 81.98 after witnessing a 5.16 per cent upswing in the previous session. Considering today's closing price of Rs 81.98, the scrip has slipped 10.36 per cent from its 52-week high of Rs 91.45, a level seen on December 5 last year. Yet, it has gained 98.02 per cent from its one-year low of Rs 41.40, hit on June 20, 2022.

The state-owned power generation equipment manufacturer reported a 34.20 per cent decline in quarterly profit (Q4 FY23). Standalone net profit fell to Rs 598 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023, from Rs 909 crore a year earlier. Total expenses rose 5.4 per cent due to a sharp rise in input costs led by raw materials.

A couple of brokerages have price targets on the stock which suggest up to 50 per cent downside. Kotak Institutional Equities pegged BHEL at a fair value of Rs 39, as it believes the company's path to profitability is still unclear. Goldman Sachs has a lower target of Rs 34 for BHEL. The brokerage also felt that the profitability path is still some time away.

On the technical front, support on the counter could be seen between Rs 77 and Rs 80 levels, analysts said. The stock has resistance at around Rs 84 and a decisive breach above the said level can lift the momentum further, they added.

Vaishali Parekh, Vice-President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, ""The stock has recently given a decent rally from Rs 66 zone to touch Rs 88 levels and thereafter has witnessed a consolidation phase maintaining the support near Rs 78 levels. The near-term resistance is at around Rs 84 which needs to be breached decisively to carry on the momentum further.""

Sneha Seth, Derivatives Research Analyst at Angel One, said, ""BHEL has formed a strong base around Rs 77-77.50. The overall chart structure looks good until it manages to sustain above the mentioned support zone.""

Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said, ""The counter has seen a nice up move after making the base near Rs 78-80 levels. At the current juncture, it is trading near its resistance zone of Rs 84. Fresh longs will only get triggered once it gets a daily close above Rs 84 for a target of Rs 90 and stop-loss would be placed at Rs 80. As of now wait and watch.""

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""BHEL has strong resistance at Rs 83.60 on the daily charts. A daily close above this resistance could lead to a target of Rs 88 in the near term. Support will be at Rs 78.20.""

Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks extended their gains for the fourth straight session, led by gains in banks, financials, consumer goods and technology stocks.

The Centre wanted to know the delay in the commissioning of the two units, and following this, we explained the reasons; and the projects were escalated up to the Cabinet Secretariat-level which in turn pressurised BHEL to complete the projects,” said an additional chief secretary.

The Project Monitoring Group under the Cabinet Secretariat regularly reviews progress of public sector projects and takes action if there is any delay.

The Additional Chief Secretary said many thermal project contracts are won by BHEL across the country as the company quotes much less compared to various private companies. The chairmen of various state-owned distribution companies, while floating the tender for any thermal unit, pretty much know that the projects will be commissioned on the scheduled date if it is given to a private company like L&T or Tata Power.

“But all the discom chiefs are afraid of the CAG audit which will raise queries as to why the unit was not given to BHEL whose cost is much less. BHEL has not revised the cost in several years due to which it is much low,” said the official.

The two units of the Ennore SEZ were scheduled to be completed in 2021. “The first unit was to be commissioned in April 2021 and second one in June 2021, and the projects’ time period was 42 months with the ‘zero date’ being September 2014. But the two units are not even close to completion though two years have gone by beyond the scheduled date,” said the official.

Similarly, the North Chennai 3 unit was to be commissioned in 2019-20. “This is the only unit of TANGEDCO which is very close to be commissioned. Though delayed by nearly two years, we are hopeful of this unit, (800MW) first-of-its-kind in Tamil Nadu, starting power generation at least by the year end,” said the official.

He said though the world wants all countries to move towards renewable power, still in India, thermal units are the main source of power. “Renewable power needs battery support, and unless this is available, thermal will be the main source of power supply and there is no way we can shut our thermal units in the next decade or beyond,” said the official."	"Thermal power projects in Tamil Nadu have been delayed much beyond the commissioning date mostly due to public sector unit BHEL which has the contract.

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh): Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bhopal, is working on Nuclear energy to reduce the dependability on coal, said BHEL, Bhopal ED Vinay Nigam on Monday.

Nuclear energy is the only way to reduce dependability on coal in the coming years, said the ED ,adding that BHEL is making steam turbine generators and cooling systems.

Earlier, the government had decided to switch over to renewable energy like solar and wind to reduce carbon emissions but it was not possible so now we are open to coal for thermal power plants as solar plants work only in day time and require a supporting system to run after the sunset, Nigam further said.

“Just because of power theft in slums, BHEL is facing a loss of Rs 10 crore annually. Government has assured us of the installation of electricity meters to check the power theft.”

BHEL posts profit of Rs 68.5 cr in 2022-23

BHEL, Bhopal, has registered a profit of Rs 68.5 crore in 2022-23 after facing loss for three consecutive years. BHEL has a target of Rs 4000 crore for 2023-24. BHEL has orders worth Rs 3320 cr and has target of Rs 9371 cr for 2023-24. Loss was due to non-supply of raw material and poor demands due to Russia and Ukraine conflict, BHEL ED said.

BHEL, Bhopal, will supply motors for Vande Bharat trains. The cost per motor will be Rs 120 crore. Other units are making other parts, BHEL, Bhopal, will manufacture motors.

38	BHARTIARTL	Bharti Airtel Ltd	Pesky calls: Telcos to roll out platform to take consent of users in 2 months	"Soon unwanted mobile phone calls and SMS could become a thing of the past. Telecom operators, including Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, are setting up a new platform to take consent of users who want to receive calls and messages only from specific businesses such as their banks, stock brokers and vendors, while blocking other telemarketers.

This comes after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a circular to all telecom operators to develop and deploy a unified platform called the Digital Consent Acquisition (DCA) facility. The system will allow telecom operators to block all calls and messages that the user has not consented to receive. TRAI expects to develop such facilities within two months.

The new system is an improvement on the existing platform. For example, in the existing system, consent is maintained by third-party principle entities, such as banks, financial services companies, and hospitals etc, which means telecom operators are unable to check for the veracity of the consent, and users cannot revoke consent using a unified framework.

Also read TRAI must be careful while allocating spectrum to LEO players: Dish TV

Under the Do Not Disturb (DND) system users’ consent was given as a default and they had to apply to put their phone numbers under the DND list.

“Even after putting phone numbers under DND, users were getting pesky calls because the telecom operators were not checking. Brands that were using third-party telemarketing agencies were also not looking if they were scrubbing against the DND list before calling. The DCA process will have the facility to seek, maintain and revoke the consent of customers. The consent data thus collected will be shared on a Digital Ledger Platform for scrubbing by all telecom operators thus ensuring that consumers receive calls from businesses only if they give prior consent,” said an industry expert.

Fiat to telcos

TRAI has directed telecom operators to develop and deploy DCA as a priority. In the first phase, only subscriber-initiated consent acquisition has been permitted by TRAI. Subsequently, companies can directly seek consent.

“Initially, principal entities belonging to the banking, insurance, finance and trading-related sectors shall be on-boarded to initiate consent acquisition process and the remaining sectors shall be onboarded subsequently,” TRAI said in a circular.

40	BPCL	Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd	BPCL to add 165 EV charging corridors by March; to add 7.5 bn litres of ethanol capacity	"Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), the country’s second largest public sector oil marketing company (OMC), is rapidly expanding capacity in the green energy space. The company has taken the lead in promoting cleaner vehicle fuels like ethanol and charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs), a top BCPL executive said.

According to P.S. Ravi, Executive Director of BPCL, the Mumbai-headquartered energy major has already set up 85 EV fast-charging corridors across the country—each covering 1,000 km of roads through its multiple fuel stations on the respective routes. “These currently cover 85,000 km,” said Ravi in a presentation at an event in New Delhi, organised by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

In its bid to establish BPCL at the forefront of clean energy initiatives, BPCL now plans to expand the number of such corridors to 250 by March 2024, he said.

Additionally, to bring down the use of petroleum-based fossil fuels that emit high quantities of harmful gases like carbon dioxide, the Union government has been pushing for higher ethanol blending in retail fuels like petrol. According to Ravi, BPCL is expanding its ethanol production capacity rapidly.

“While currently we have 5 billion litres of ethanol production capacity per year, the demand is for about 10 billion litres. So, we have already begun to set up new plants that will together add at least 7.5 billion litres per year capacity. These will take our total ethanol production capacity to 12.5-13 billion litres,” he said.

Data shows that ethanol blending in India has risen sharply since 2019-20. From about 5 per cent ethanol blending in fossil fuels in 2019-20, the share has risen to 11.7 per cent in 2022-23. In the past 10 years, the increase in ethanol production has been in the tune of 1,100 per cent (over 2013-14). As a result, the 10 per cent ethanol blending target, set for November 2022, was achieved in June, 2022, he said."	"According to Ravi, BPCL is expanding its ethanol production capacity rapidly.

45	COROMANDEL	Coromandel International Ltd	‘Death Toll Could Have Been Less’: Expert Opinion On Coromandel Express Accident	"The Chennai-bound Coromandel Express from Shalimar would have derailed even if it had not collided with the freight train at Bahanaga Bazaar station near Odisha`s Balasore on Friday evening, senior railway officials said.

According to them, the train could not have negotiated the crossover into the loop line at 127 kmph under any condition. The death toll may have been less but there would have been mass casualties even then. The rear coaches of the Coromandel Express would have also whiplashed the Yeswanthpur-Howrah Superfast Express travelling at over 100 kmph, just as they did on Friday.

Also read: Indian Railways Staff Averts Major Accident, Detects Crack In Chennai Express Coach

""Trains are supposed to negotiate the crossover at 30 kmph. At best, a train can make the crossover safely if it is travelling at 40-45 kmph. At 127 kmph, it would have been impossible. A train is not a snake that can bend or twist its body according to ground conditions. A train is a composition of coaches attached to each other by couplings. There would have been a crosspool effect. Each one needs time to turn.

""Friday`s derailment was a combination of both the collision and the sudden turn towards the loop line. Even if the collision had not taken place, the derailment would have occurred and coaches would have been flung away in all directions,"" a senior railway engineer said.

It is now confirmed that the `point` or `switch` (where the crossover to another track took place) remained in the `reverse` position after the freight train entered the loop line. Ideally, it should have moved to the normal position to allow the Coromandel Express to take the main line. This did not happen, yet the signalling team received a confirmation and turned all signals to `off` or green.

""The question that arises is why the fail-safe signals would turn to green if the point had not been reset to its normal position? Was there a problem with a relay (there are hundreds of them) or did somebody override the system to turn the red signals off? Under the fail-safe system, a signal always turns to red even if there is slight indication of a malfunction in the interlocking system.

""Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has recommended a CBI probe and it ought to find out what actually took place. I just hope that the assistance of technically competent people is taken. A Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) probe is not desired in this case. After all, the CRS is itself a railway officer and neutrality can`t be assured. There has been gross negligence in this case and those involved need to be punished. In the past, there have been judicial probes after the Gaisal and Kalubathan accidents,"" another officer said.

Even as assurances of help for families of those who died in the disaster are flowing in, long queues were witnessed outside the blood banks of hospitals in Balasore, Bhubaneswar and Cuttack where the injured have been moved for treatment.

""I travelled nearly 50 km to Balasore as I wanted to help. I am now standing in line to donate blood. I will provide any other assistance if doctors say so,"" said Amit Mohanty, a trader. Srikant, resident of a village near Bahanaga Bazaar stood next to him and recounted how many people had not slept for over 36 hours after the accident while providing help to the victims.

""We reached the spot barely 15 minutes after the accident. There was death and destruction all around. People were lying dead and we had to be careful not to step on severed limbs. It was dark and we used electric torches and motorcycle headlights to pull out people from the mangled coaches. Many were severely injured. Fortunately, the railways reacted quite fast and relief trains arrived with men and material. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams also started arriving and a proper evacuation process was started. Many passengers with minor injuries also pitched in with support to help those who were seriously affected,"" Srikant said.

Organisations like the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission in Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas, West Bengal, have also assured that it will take all responsibility of children orphaned due to the accident. Children from poor families affected by the disaster will also be taken care of, Swami Nityarupananda of the Mission tweeted."

Now, Dabur collects, processes and recycles more plastic waste than it sells in its product packaging in a year, said Dabur India Head-Operations Rahul Awasthi.

""It is a matter of great pride for the entire Dabur family, who have worked towards not just collecting plastic waste from our cities, towns and villages across the country, but also preventing the waste from reaching our landfills and oceans. This includes all types of plastic waste, from PET and HDPE bottles, PP caps and labels to multi-layered plastics and beverage cartons,"" he said.

52	DEEPAKNTR	Deepak Nitrite Ltd	Trade setup for Tuesday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.

The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.

""Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.

""The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,"" Shetti said.

The broader markets continued the uptrend for more than a couple of weeks now, with the Nifty Midcap 100 index up 0.14 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.36 percent.

Nifty Bank

The Bank Nifty continued its uptrend for the second consecutive session and rose 164 points to 44,102, forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the daily scale making higher high and higher low formation, as the market participants were cautious ahead of the outcome of a three-day policy meeting by the RBI.

""The Bank Nifty index is expected to continue to trade within the range of 43,700-44,300. This suggests that the index is likely to move sideways, lacking a clear trend,"" Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said.

56	DLF	DLF Ltd	SBI, Ultratech Cement, DLF: How should you trade these stocks?	"Domestic stock indices snapped a four-day winning streak on Wednesday, thanks to selling pressure in index heavyweights. The BSE Sensex dropped 346.89 points, or 0.55 per cent, to settle at 62,622.24. The NSE Nifty fell 99.45 points, or 0.53 per cent, to settle at 18,534.40.



Select stocks including State Bank of India, DLF and Ultratech Cement are likely to be in limelight in Thursday’s session. Here is what Amit Trivedi, Senior Derivatives Analyst at YES Securities has to say on these stocks ahead of Thursday's trading session:

State Bank of India | Hold | Resistance: Rs 560-565

The PSU Bank index has been consistent outperformer. But, after a multi week up move, select PSU banking stocks have witnessed profit taking. For State Bank of India, the overall structure remains positive. But the choppy trading in SBI this week and the inability to hold current levels could attract mild throwback till Rs 560-565 zone.



DLF | Hold | Resistance: Rs 505 | Support: Rs 455

Retaining a series of ascending tops and bottoms, DLF has been gradually trending higher. After a multi-week up move, the stock is likely to face minor consolidation with the immediate support placed near Rs 455 level. Eventually, the stock is likely to resume its upward trajectory and a level of Rs 505 looks achievable.



Ultratech Cement | Buy | Target Price: Rs 8,200 | Stop Loss: Rs 7,500

After taking a pause in the previous month, Ultratech Cement has resumed its gradual up-move. Amid a series of ascending tops and bottoms, important support is placed near Rs 7,500. A sustenance above Rs 7,750 would mean that the stock has more room on upside. In that case, a further up move till Rs 8,200 would be possible.

57	DIXON	Dixon Technologies (India) Ltd	Samsung Electronics faces potential exclusion from India’s PLI scheme due to invoicing discrepancies	"Samsung Electronics, one of the leading global electronics manufacturers, may not receive the incentives promised under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphone manufacturing in its inaugural year. This is due to what government officials describe as ""discrepancies in invoicing."" However, Samsung has expressed that it is engaged in advanced discussions with the government to resolve the issue, according to an Economic Times report.

Last August, Samsung claimed Rs 900 crore in incentives for achieving Rs 15,000 crore worth of additional sales in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the previous year. To be eligible for these incentives, Samsung had to produce handsets with a factory cost exceeding $200 (approximately Rs 15,000). Unfortunately, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) discovered ""some discrepancies in the company's invoices"" and subsequently withheld the payout.

A representative from Samsung, which recently reclaimed its position as India's largest smartphone brand, confirmed ongoing discussions with the government regarding this matter, according to a statement made to the Economic Times.

One senior government official mentioned to ET that there were valuation issues with Samsung's invoices and that while the invoices are now accurate and being verified, the incentives for the first year are unlikely to be recovered. However, the official did note that Samsung has rectified its billing, and the incentive payouts for the second year of the PLI scheme, starting from the fiscal year 2022, will begin soon.

Other global manufacturers such as Foxconn (Hon Hai) and Wistron, known for producing iPhones, as well as domestic companies like Dixon Technologies, have already received their incentives for the fiscal year 2022.

It's worth noting that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also required companies, both domestic and foreign, to make certain investments to qualify for the incentives under the PLI scheme. Officials have stated that there have been no queries regarding Samsung's investments.

The mobile handset PLI scheme, launched in August 2020, has a total budget of Rs 40,951 crore spread over five years. The scheme offers graded incentives or cashback equivalent to 6 per cent of incremental sales achieved over the base year for the first and second years. The incentives reduce to 5 per cent for the third and fourth years and 4 per cent for the fifth year.

In Samsung's case, the 6 per cent cashback amounts to Rs 900 crore.

To be eligible for these incentives, global companies like Samsung must invest a minimum of Rs 250 crore in the first fiscal year, followed by similar amounts in each of the subsequent three fiscal years. Additionally, they need to produce incremental goods, such as mobile phones with an invoice value of Rs 15,000 and above, worth Rs 4,000 crore, Rs 8,000 crore, Rs 15,000 crore, Rs 25,000 crore, and finally Rs 50,000 crore over five consecutive years.

Indian handset makers, on the other hand, must invest Rs 50 crore in each of the first four fiscal years and achieve Rs 500 crore of incremental sales for each of the five fiscal years to qualify for the same incentives.

Apart from Samsung, no other global company managed to meet the incentive targets of the PLI scheme in the first year, FY21, primarily due to the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, which severely affected electronics manufacturing supply chains. In response, India decided to extend the PLI scheme to six years from the original five. All companies were given the flexibility to choose any of the five years within the six-year tenure to meet the targets and claim financial incentives. Samsung opted to start with the original year of FY21.

In the first year of the PLI scheme, Samsung initiated the production of high-value phones in India while outsourcing the manufacturing of lower-segment phones to contract manufacturers. This strategy enabled the company to achieve its targets and qualify for the incentives.

In addition to Samsung, other global companies approved for incentives include Foxconn (Hon Hai) and Rising Star from Taiwan, as well as Wistron and Pegatron, known for manufacturing iPhones. The list of approved applicants also includes Indian companies like Dixon, Lava, Bhagwati (Micromax), Padget Electronics, UTL Neolyncs, and Optiemus Electronics."	"Samsung Electronics, one of the leading global electronics manufacturers, may not receive the incentives promised under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphone manufacturing in its inaugural year.
To be eligible for these incentives, Samsung had to produce handsets with a factory cost exceeding $200 (approximately Rs 15,000).
Additionally, they need to produce incremental goods, such as mobile phones with an invoice value of Rs 15,000 and above, worth Rs 4,000 crore, Rs 8,000 crore, Rs 15,000 crore, Rs 25,000 crore, and finally Rs 50,000 crore over five consecutive years.

Bank Nifty index fell more than 300 points to close at 44,128, but defended 44,000 mark and saw some recovery from day's low.

Stocks that turned outperformer included PI Industries, which rose 4 percent to Rs 3,616.8, the highest closing level since November 9 last year, and formed strong bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes. Broadly, the stock remained in an uptrend since May 19, barring intermittent small correction.

Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Dixon Technologies

Since last 3 months, it has already given 50 percent return from the low of Rs 2,600 till Rs 3,900. At current juncture price action is facing resistance near 0.618 retracement levels of previous down move.

Additionally, it has made hidden divergence (refer to the chart ). One can book profit in the zone of Rs 3,800-4,000 levels. As of now no fresh longs are recommended.

PI Industries

Though PI Industries might be looking lucrative due to recent up moves in the counter, one can see that it is currently approaching its historical resistance of Rs 3,650-3,700. Having said that, it has already given 20 percent return in the last 2 months.

Last but not the least, it is way above 200 DEMA (daily exponential moving average ) so mean reversion could be possible if it gets rejected from its above-mentioned resistance zone.

One can book profit in the zone of Rs 3,600-3,700 levels. As of now no fresh longs are recommended.

Central Depository Services (CDSL)

For the entire month of May 2023, it consolidated in the zone of Rs 970-1,000. In previous trading sessions, it gave massive breakout along with huge volume which is hinting at bullish momentum in the coming few sessions.

The best part of above-mentioned consolidation zone of Rs 970-1,000 is that those were the levels of monthly central pivot range (refer to the chart). So, one can buy in small tranche in the zones of Rs 1,035-1,045 and another Rs 1,015-1,020 with an upside target of Rs 1,120 and stop-loss would be Rs 990 on daily close basis.

60	EICHERMOT	Eicher Motors Ltd	Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland: Auto stocks that analysts like post May sales data	"Auto wholesale volumes for May came in steady, with a sequential recovery witnessed across segments. Analysts said rural demand recovery was visible with motorcycle sales growth coming in ahead of scooter sales growth on month-on-month (MoM) basis. Export too staged a comeback and was up on MoM basis for most of the OEMs, they said.

ICICIdirect said Hero MotoCorp led the growth in the two-wheeler segment, Maruti Suzuki in personal vehicle (PV) space, Tata Motors in commercial vehicle (CV) sales and Escorts in the tractor segment. Analysts largely positive on shares of Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.

May sales data

Among automakers, Maruti Suzuki’s volumes for the month stood at 1.8 lakh units, up 10.9 per cent MoM. Tata Motors' total sales came in at 74,973 units, up 7.7 per cent MoM. Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive segment volumes de-grew 1.4 per cent MoM to 61,415 units. For Ashok Leyland, volumes were up 1.2 per cent MoM at 13,134 units and was led by M&HCV segment.

Among two-wheeler makers, Hero MotoCorp led the volume recovery with total volumes rising 31 per cent MoM to 5.2 lakh units. Bajaj Auto's volumes were up 7.2 per cent MoM at 3.6 lakh units. Domestic sales were up 7.1 per cent while exports logged 7.3 per cent growth for Bajaj Auto. TVS Motors’ two-wheeler sales were up 8.3 per cent MoM to 3.2 lakh units. its three-wheeler sales were broadly flat MoM.

ICICIdirect said chip supplies continue to limit the production ramp-up in the PV segment despite healthy order-book across. In the CV space, growth at the industry leader was encouraging amid guidance for YoY decline in Q1FY24 tracking high base of last year & pre-buying witnessed in Q4FY23. In the tractor space, numbers were a mixed bag amid guidance of low single digit growth in FY24E.

Auto stocks that analysts like

Within OEMs, Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto. It said industry wholesale volumes for PV segment were ahead of its estimates while medium-heavy commercial vehicles and two-wheeler wholesales were largely in-line.

Motilal Oswal Securities said it prefers CVs over other segments, considering strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We prefer companies with: higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, encouraging margin drivers, and a strong balance sheet. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the broker's top OEM picks.

Anand Rathi has retained its optimistic view on the auto sector and suggested Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp as its preferred picks.

""In PV segment, wholesales in near-term are likely to be a function of further normalisation of supplies and response to recent model launches. Two-wheeler demand remains contingent on rural sentiments. Steady freight rates are supporting CV operators. Rising interest rates, however, remains a key deterrent. We expect CV volumes to be supported by demand from infra & construction sectors,"" JM Financial said.

Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | Buy | Target Price: Rs 5,450-5,500 | Stop Loss: Rs 4,550

From the last six months, Apollo Hospitals has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 4,900-4.150 levels as big wild swings kept the stock volatile over the period of months. At the current juncture, a fresh breakout in prices has been witnessed, after a period of prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden spike in volumes suggests strength in current moves. Additionally, positive divergences on secondary oscillators on daily and weekly charts also support the next upswing in the prices. Therefore, one can buy the stock in the range of Rs 4,900-4,950 levels for the upside target of Rs 5,450-5,500 levels with stop loss below Rs 4,550 levels.

Escorts Kubota rose about a percent on June 1 morning after the company said it recorded its highest-ever sales in May, even as tractor sales have been slowing for the industry.

Escorts Kubota Limited Agri Machinery Business Division sold 9,167 tractors in May, its highest sales for the month, registering a growth of 8.9 percent against 8,421 units in the year-ago period.

Domestic tractor sales in May 2023 were at 8,704 units, up 13.5 percent from 7,667 in May 2022, the company said in an exchange filing.

At 10 am, the stock was trading at Rs 2,188 on BSE, up 0.7 percent, after rising to Rs 2,214 earlier.

“Overall, the macroeconomic factors and farmer sentiments remain positive, resulting in a positive sales trend across most geographies. Going forward, we expect the current momentum to continue in the near term led by normal rainfall forecast, adequate reservoir levels, better liquidity and consumer credit availability,” the company said.

Drop in exports remains a challenge for the industry. Escorts Kubota exported 463 tractors in May against 754 in the year-ago period.

Escorts Kubota has diversified business across three divisions—agri machinery, construction equipment and railway equipment.

Analysts have a mixed view on the stock.

Those at BOB Capital believe that medium-term pain for the company will continue and thus have a “sell” rating with the target at Rs 1,749.

The company has benefitted from cost inflation tailwinds as gross margin expanded QoQ but a reversal of price trends in Q1FY24 has weakened the margin outlook, it said.

Axis Direct, however, has a “buy” rating with the target at Rs 2,310. Motilal Oswal is neutral on the stock with the target at Rs 1,900.

“Near-term demand outlook continues to remain positive. led by healthy agri sentiments,” Motilal Oswal said in a note. “This should be further benefitted by lower channel inventory and the company’s focus on market share gains. Hence we expect ~7 percent volume CAGR over FY23-25. However, high base of FY23, uncertain monsoon forecast for CY23 and the impact of implementation of TREM-4 (emission standard for tractors) norms for <50HP tractors (likely in FY25) would be the key monitorable.”

63	GAIL	GAIL (India) Ltd	F&O Query: Should I buy natural gas futures? Will GAIL futures recover?	"Kindly guide on natural gas call as it was provided on May expiry (₹194) while June price was at huge premium (at around ₹210) on May 24. Now that all premium is gone, should I initiate a buy position?

Dipak Lakhani

When the natural gas futures was trading at around ₹194 on May 24, we had recommended initiating long positions if the price falls to ₹180. In the subsequent sessions, the contract fell and it is now hovering around ₹180.

Therefore, you can consider going long on natural gas futures contract now. Initial stop-loss can be placed at ₹168. When the contract rallies past ₹200, alter the stop-loss to ₹190. Further, when the contract touches ₹205, tighten the stop-loss to ₹195. Liquidate the longs at ₹212. Note that the target is revised down from ₹215 to ₹212, adjusting for the recent price action in the June contract.

I have a position on GAIL futures contract at ₹109. Kindly advise.

Abhiram Pendharkar

It would help if you mention whether you have a long or short position.

GAIL (India) futures (₹105.45): The price of GAIL futures contract has been on a fall over the past few days. However, broadly, the underlying stock seems to be stuck in the range of ₹104-112 since March. That means, the stock, and consequently its futures, is trading near the support. Specifically, the futures has a support band between ₹104 and ₹105. So, assuming that you have long futures, we advise you to hold the position. But keep a stop-loss a little below the support at ₹104, say at ₹103.

However, as things stand, the likelihood of closing this trade with a profit looks less likely. Because, the contract has a stiff resistance at ₹109. So, we suggest exiting the longs when the price recovers to ₹109. You may consider fresh buys, if GAIL futures break out of the resistance at ₹109. In such a case, keep stop-loss at ₹107 and look for a target of ₹114.

In case you are holding a short position taken at ₹109, we suggest booking profits now at around ₹105 for the same reason that the ₹104-105 price region is a support band against which the GAIL futures could see a rebound in price.

As far as CASA is concerned, I think again it is a great story. Their CASA mobilisation has been fabulous which has led to I think the lowest cost of fund about 3.44% amongst the public sector banks ,"" says Sudip Bandyopadhyay I think they have done a fabulous job over the last few quarters and years. As we know this is a PAN India bank with a strong presence in highly industrialised states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. What has happened is they have shown remarkable deposit growth and advance growth. I think the advance growth is almost two times the average advance growth of other PSBs. And I was reading a management view and there they are confident of maintaining at least 1.5 times of the average growth for the advances.I think that is a commendable kind of confidence which they have shown. As far as CASA is concerned, I think again it is a great story. Their CASA mobilisation has been fabulous which has led to I think the lowest cost of fund about 3.44% amongst the public sector banks.This has led to a decent and ever-growing margin, net interest margin of close to 4% and I think that is a pretty commendable considering the bank has gone through quite a lot over the years.At this stage, I think asset quality also is improving and all the signs are there for a massive up move from the current levels. So from a long term investor point of view, I think around the current market level of 30, one can enter and look for a target of between 45 and 50 in one year.I think the bank is on the right track. And if they continue on this track, I think they will become soon recognised as one of the better performing public sector banks with a possibility of significant upside. Now, as I am saying within a year plus, I think we can look at about 45 to 50 and within two years, I think they can double from current levels.But the pace of growth has to be maintained and the CASA mobilisation momentum also has to be maintained. The way the management is confident, I think that looks promising.I think this is a bank which has gone through a lot of challenges and a lot of ups and downs. Last quarter results did not impress the market. I think they did see some margin compression as well as a little bit of challenges on their CASA growth. So the retail deposits had grown by close to 85% in the last financial year vis-à-vis about 92% in the previous financial year and these things were not liked by the market.But having said that, I think if you look at the asset quality performance, look at the advances growth and look at overall operational efficiency, I think Federal Bank is on the right track.One quarter CASA growth, a little bit slowing down and the margin getting a little bit of squeezed. I do not think we can take a long term view. And I think I consider these kind of aberrations and market correction an opportunity for acquiring good performing banks like Federal Bank.Also, the management stability is there with the managing director, incumbent managing director getting an extension from RBI. So at least the question of management change and destabilisation does not come in the near future and that is pretty reassuring when you look at a similar situation in some of the other banks.Overall, the market in which they are operating also has significant growth potential. And we look at a figure of around between 160 and 170 in a year's time."	"As far as CASA is concerned, I think again it is a great story.

It said Grasim is eyeing to be the second-largest paint player in India, while JSW is eyeing around 10% market share by FY26.Meanwhile, Asian Paints, the largest player in the paints sector, has plans to invest '10,000 crore to add 0.9 million kilolitres capacity, including greenfield and brownfield facilities, the report said.Separately, Crisil Ratings said in April that while the paints industry's operating margin would improve due to a 30% fall in crude oil prices (a key raw material), it will be largely offset by higher selling expenses due to aggressive sales push and increase in ad spend by players to counter competition from new entrants.Last year, JK Cement announced a foray into the paint business with ₹600 crore investments, while Astral entered the business by acquiring a 51% stake in Gems Paints.

71	GRASIM	Grasim Industries Ltd	Grasim Beta Tests Its Painting Services Under ‘Sparkle’ In Three Cities	"Grasim Industries Ltd. test-launched its painting services in three cities as it eyes the second spot in the sector dominated by Asian Paints Ltd.

The flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group is testing its 'Sparkle' service in Mumbai, Pune, and Bengaluru, Jefferies said in a report, calling it an ""interesting"" move.

That comes even before Grasim is scheduled to commission its first paints manufacturing facility in March 2024. Sparkle, which uses products procured from authorised dealers of rival paint companies, is currently open only to employees of Aditya Birla Group and their friends and family.

Grasim will face an ""uphill task"" in its paints foray, Jefferies said citing interactions with investors. While smaller players may be impacted, the brokerage said in a report, Asian Paints is likely to remain unscathed.

Success may not be guaranteed but the company's Rs 10,000-crore investment will likely push new entrants to adopt an aggressive stance to ramp up production.

That would likely entail steps like channel push, higher discounts, and promotions for dealers and even painters, which could impact the industry's profitability, at least in the medium term, Jefferies said. The issue is exacerbated by small- to mid-sized players that are also eyeing the opportunity and may adopt a regional strategy, the brokerage said.

Like Grasim, JSW Paints Ltd., JK Cement Ltd., Pidilite Industries Ltd., and Astral Ltd. are looking to leverage their brand recall in the building material space, along with a distribution network that overlaps with paints, to enter the industry.

Over the next two to three years, the paint industry is expected to increase capacity by 25%. The total industry outlay is expected to be Rs 22,000 crore, of which Grasim is investing nearly 50%. Asian Paints will also invest close to Rs 10,000 crore, increasing its capacity by 50%.

73	HINDPETRO	Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd	After Reliance-bp, Nayara Energy sells petrol, diesel at Re 1 less than PSUs	"After Reliance-bp, Nayara Energy sells petrol, diesel at Re 1 less than PSUs

live bse live

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

After Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc of the UK, Nayara Energy - the nation's largest private fuel retailer - has started selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 less than the fuel sold by state-owned retailers, officials said.

While state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) continue to hold prices despite a drop in international rates, private fuel retailers have started passing on the benefit to consumers.

""To further stimulate domestic consumption and cater to local customers better, we have introduced a Re 1 discount in our retail outlets until the end of June 2023,"" a spokesperson for Nayara Energy said.

""We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demand."" Nayara Energy, which owns over 7 per cent of India's 86,925 petrol pumps, is selling petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre less than that by IOC, BPCL and HPCL in 10 states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

Earlier this month, Jio-bp, the retail fuel joint venture of Reliance and bp, started selling superior grade diesel at Re 1 per litre cheaper than normal or regular grade diesel sold by state-owned companies.

The additive-enhanced diesel helps clean dirt deposits in engines and can improve fuel efficiency.

While Reliance-bp has priced only diesel less than that of PSUs, Nayara is selling both diesel and petrol at rates below state-owned firms'.

IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen retail prices when international oil prices climbed in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. While international oil prices have declined, retail prices continue to be on hold for a record 14th month in a row as they recoup the losses suffered last year.

Prices of crude oil, which is turned into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, shot above USD 100 per barrel on concerns of supply disruptions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. While there was no supply disruption, rates continued to remain firm for months thereafter.

To insulate domestic consumers, they stopped daily price revisions from April 6, 2022. As a result of selling fuel below cost, IOC, BPCL and HPCL posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during April-September.

During this period, private fuel retailers Reliance BP Mobility Ltd (RBML), Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell lost market share as they were unable to match the below-cost frozen rates of dominant public sector retailers.

But a fall in international oil prices since March has helped bring their retail prices at par with PSU competition or at market price.

IOC, BPCL and HPCL too have broken even but continue to hold retail prices to recoup past losses. This has helped IOC and BPCL post profits in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year despite losses in the first half.

Industry sources said Nayara started pricing petrol and diesel at market rates sometime in March and RBML's 1,574 petrol pumps began selling diesel at par from this month.

This month, Jio-bp introduced superior-grade diesel at rates lower than even the normal diesel sold by state-owned firms. Nayara has followed suit with a similar discount on both petrol and diesel in 10 states.

IOC, BPCL and HPCL first froze petrol and diesel rates for 137 days beginning early November 2021 when five states including Uttar Pradesh went to the polls. A second round of hiatus began on April 6, 2022, and is continuing.

Nayara Energy owns 6,376 petrol pumps in the country. IOC, BPCL and HPCL own 78,567 out of 86,925 petrol pumps in the country."

The Nifty, which traded within the previous day's range, formed a small bodied bearish candlestick with minor upper and long lower shadows on the daily charts. The pattern indicates formation of Inside Bar candle with overlapping candles.

""The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms continued as per daily timeframe chart and the present consolidation could be in line with the higher bottom formation of the pattern. The higher bottom reversal pattern has not been confirmed yet,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, said.

Considering the recent consolidation and the subsequent negation of such bearish patterns, one can expect a bounce in the market in the coming week, he said. For Nifty, immediate support is at 18,400-18,300 and the upside hurdle is at 18,650-18,850, Shetti said.

The broader market outperformed the benchmark. Nifty midcap 100 and smallcap 100 indices gained half a percent each.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Zinc

Hindustan Zinc (HZL) is India's largest and the world's second largest integrated zinc producer and is one of the lowest cost producers of zinc globally. HZL is a 64.92% subsidiary of VEDL and 29.54% of its stake is held by government. It commands 80% market share in primary zinc market in India and operates the world's largest UG zinc mine at Rampura Agucha along with mines at Sindesar Khurd, Rajpura Dariba, Zawar and Kayad. It has a total ore reserves of 173.5mt and R&R of 460.1mt containing 30.8mt of metal content (~6.6%). HZL has total mined metal capacity of 1.2mt and smelting capacity of 1.123mt and is further ramping up its UG mines to reach a mined metal capacity of 1.35mt and eventually 1.5mt. The company is all set to capture the growing domestic steel and automobile demand amid rapid expansion in infrastructure and construction, as well as improved standard of living and urbanization. As India inches towards the 300mt crude steel production target by FY30-31, the demand for galvanized steel is likely to outpace other metals. HZL has a strong focus on value added products (VAP). The share of VAP stands at ~20% of the total sales, which is expected to gradually rise to 24% by FY25.

Outlook

While HZL is well placed, the stock trades at 6.1x FY24E EV/EBITDA and appears to be fully discounting the benefits. We maintain our Neutral rating on the stock with a TP of INR300 (premised on 6x FY24E EV/EBITDA).

However, it's not expected to see a big increase in such activities overall, according to experts. There are very few large-size issuers like Go Digit looking to raise capital in the primary market, which means they want to issue new shares or instruments to raise money. However, it may be early next year when they are able to hit the market."

78	HCLTECH	HCL Technologies Ltd	Salaries of some HCL Tech employees may be reduced as company changes pay policy in post-pandemic era	"Some employees at the Indian IT firm HCL Technologies may face a reduction in overall compensation as the company has decided to revise the Engagement Performance Bonus policy, which is a part of the workers' variable pay. While HCL Tech's net profit rose to 11 per cent YoY in Q42023 ended on March 31, the company's move to reduce variable pay comes as most tech firms globally are laying off employees to manage their expenses under challenging macroeconomic conditions. HCL Tech has also revised the EPB policy, and going forward, eligible employees will receive EPB quarterly. ""Employees on the bench"" would not be eligible to receive EPB, which automatically reduces their monthly salary.

According to Business Today, HCL Tech informed employees about the change via email. The email obtained by the publication reads, ""Employees will be paid EPB basis the Quarterly Manager Feedback in My Performance effective April 1, 2023. Key performance parameters, targets will be defined. At the end of every quarter, a score-based performance review will be triggered. Employees on bench will not be eligible for EPB payout for the period they are on bench."" The report adds that employees who may quit mid-quarter will not receive EPB, which could be standard practice across industries.

HCL Tech also clarified changes to the publication. In a statement, a spokesperson said that the IT company paid 100 per cent EPB to eligible employees to support them during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new changes were made considering the state of the COVID-19 outbreak in India and globally. The full statement reads:

""At HCLTech, we have always offered an Engagement 'Performance' Bonus (EPB) as part of our total compensation package up to the E3 band. The EPB is typically 3-4 per cent of total compensation, and the average payout is approximately 80 per cent. Our employment contract identifies EPB as performance-linked variable pay, and this is governed by company policy. To support employees during the pandemic, the company made a policy exception and paid 100 per cent EPB irrespective of performance. Post-pandemic, the company is reverting to the original policy.

79	HINDUNILVR	Hindustan Unilever Ltd	HUL starts price cuts in some categories	"Dealers and major distributors of Hindustan Unilever have started destocking high-cost inventory as the FMCG major has commenced price cuts in certain categories with more reductions in the offing.

An HUL spokesperson confirmed the price cuts with commodity prices such as that of palm oil, tea and crude oil having come off their highs.

Also read: Editorial. For companies, input cost pressures ease but business growth uncertain

Data drive

“Price cuts are taken in large chunks to minimise trade pipeline disruption. Our pricing actions extensively use data and analytics and are based on the principles of Net Revenue Management,” the spokesperson told businessline in response to an email seeking clarification.

Trade sources said that price reductions have been taken in categories such as laundry products, skin cleansers, soaps and in tea. In anticipation, stockists are clearing their high-cost inventory and waiting for fresh stocks to arrive. In such a scenario it is usual to see a surge in secondary sales – from wholesalers to retailers, compared to primary sales that is from the company to wholesalers.

More price cuts are likely to follow as commodity prices have significantly cooled.

Some respite

HDFC Securities in a note last week said that most crops along with palm oil, crude oil and crude derivatives have all seen meaningful price corrections in recent months, providing relief to consumer goods companies.

The rise in commodity prices over the last couple of years saw FMCG companies having to struggle with unprecedented inflation and soaring raw material costs. Job losses, fewer job opportunities and salary cuts — seen during the pandemic — also meant lower sales volumes and the only way that FMCG companies could protect their margins and bottomlines was through calibrated price hikes once the pandemic ended. HUL said that it had been focussed on protecting its business model while growing its franchise, during the inflationary period.

Editorial Party is over

Not all the cost increase was passed on and HUL did see a negative impact on its gross margin. The company said that during the last two years, the cumulative net material inflation was 30 per cent but its price hikes lagged that. Also, for customers at the bottom of the value chain the price hike was much lower.

Over the last two fiscal years, HUL took a cumulative 18 per cent price increase. In FY23, of the 16 per cent growth in its topline, 11 per cent came through price growth. In the March quarter, the price growth was 7 per cent, showing the deceleration of inflation."

80	HEROMOTOCO	Hero MotoCorp Ltd	Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland: Auto stocks that analysts like post May sales data	"Auto wholesale volumes for May came in steady, with a sequential recovery witnessed across segments. Analysts said rural demand recovery was visible with motorcycle sales growth coming in ahead of scooter sales growth on month-on-month (MoM) basis. Export too staged a comeback and was up on MoM basis for most of the OEMs, they said.

ICICIdirect said Hero MotoCorp led the growth in the two-wheeler segment, Maruti Suzuki in personal vehicle (PV) space, Tata Motors in commercial vehicle (CV) sales and Escorts in the tractor segment. Analysts largely positive on shares of Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.

May sales data

Among automakers, Maruti Suzuki’s volumes for the month stood at 1.8 lakh units, up 10.9 per cent MoM. Tata Motors' total sales came in at 74,973 units, up 7.7 per cent MoM. Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive segment volumes de-grew 1.4 per cent MoM to 61,415 units. For Ashok Leyland, volumes were up 1.2 per cent MoM at 13,134 units and was led by M&HCV segment.

Among two-wheeler makers, Hero MotoCorp led the volume recovery with total volumes rising 31 per cent MoM to 5.2 lakh units. Bajaj Auto's volumes were up 7.2 per cent MoM at 3.6 lakh units. Domestic sales were up 7.1 per cent while exports logged 7.3 per cent growth for Bajaj Auto. TVS Motors’ two-wheeler sales were up 8.3 per cent MoM to 3.2 lakh units. its three-wheeler sales were broadly flat MoM.

ICICIdirect said chip supplies continue to limit the production ramp-up in the PV segment despite healthy order-book across. In the CV space, growth at the industry leader was encouraging amid guidance for YoY decline in Q1FY24 tracking high base of last year & pre-buying witnessed in Q4FY23. In the tractor space, numbers were a mixed bag amid guidance of low single digit growth in FY24E.

Auto stocks that analysts like

Within OEMs, Nomura India prefers Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto. It said industry wholesale volumes for PV segment were ahead of its estimates while medium-heavy commercial vehicles and two-wheeler wholesales were largely in-line.

Motilal Oswal Securities said it prefers CVs over other segments, considering strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We prefer companies with: higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, encouraging margin drivers, and a strong balance sheet. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the broker's top OEM picks.

Anand Rathi has retained its optimistic view on the auto sector and suggested Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp as its preferred picks.

""In PV segment, wholesales in near-term are likely to be a function of further normalisation of supplies and response to recent model launches. Two-wheeler demand remains contingent on rural sentiments. Steady freight rates are supporting CV operators. Rising interest rates, however, remains a key deterrent. We expect CV volumes to be supported by demand from infra & construction sectors,"" JM Financial said.

81	HDFCAMC	HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd	SEBI’s new total expense ratio proposal may hit HDFC AMC most	"HDFC AMC’s revenue is likely to be hit more by SEBI’s new proposal to impose uniform total expense ratio (TER) for all asset management companies (AMCs) that aims to enhance transparency in the costs charged to unitholders.

However, brokerages point out that though the new regime could result in larger listed AMCs such as HDFC AMC and those with higher hybrid mix getting impacted more, they also add that AMCs might pass through the cost impact. Besides, in the long-term AMCs will benefit to SEBI move.

According to JM Financial, the near-term impact will be higher for larger AMCs like HDFC AMC (10-12 per cent EPS cut in case 50 per cent impact is passed on to distributors/brokers), while for mid-size AMCs like NAM impact is estimated at 5-6 per cent. For UTI AMC, the EPS impact will be negligible (even positive) given the equity AUM is on a lower side.

“However, given the scale-based AUM slabs, TERs will continue to moderate as AUM of AMC,” a report from the brokerage said.

ICICI Securities said that based on the TER for respective asset classes and using the AMC-level proportion, “we see possible revenue reduction for HDFC AMC, NAM and UTI in the range of 34 per cent/19 per cent/5 per cent, respectively. However, AMCs will achieve operational efficiencies like less churn in portfolios, reducing STT and brokerage, and some will be passed through sharing with other stakeholders like RTAs and distributors. This could make the ultimate impact less.”

It added that AMCs with higher hybrid mix may be impacted more as new regime proposes bifurcation of hybrid TER between equity and debt. Amongst the listed AMCs, hybrid mix as percentage of equity mix is 36 per cent for HDFC AMC, while that for NAM and UTI it is in the range of 15-18 per cent.

SEBI in its proposal had said that it is open to performance-linked TER for active open-ended equity schemes, wherein AMCs can charge higher management fees if scheme performance is more than an indicative return above the tracking difference adjusted benchmark.

ICICI Securities raised a concern that though this is “optional as of now, this performance-based model can have deeper ramifications if implemented.“

TER is the revenue source for the entire asset management ecosystem, and it remains to be seen how the cut is managed between stakeholders, said brokerages.

Kotak Institutional Equities shared its insights from interactions with AMCs and distributors. “High confidence from AMCs to pass on a very large share of TER hit; and impact on distributors to be shared with sub-brokers with greater push for other products (insurance and credit).”

ICICI Securities pointed out historical data where distributors saw a cut in commission rates. “This move triggered a consolidation in the industry and also led to individual ARN registrations declining 51 per cent YoY in FY20 and 35 per cent in FY21. Based on AMFI data, industry’s overall commission payout reduced from 0.93 per cent in FY18 to 0.79 per cent in FY19 and 0.61 per cent in FY20,” it added.

The industry will likely represent on issues such as impact on arbitrage funds, inclusion of statutory levies in TER and keeping switch transactions within the same asset class. With the regulatory overhang addressed, a high (75-100 per cent) pass-through of the impact could present upside possibilities for AMC stocks, said Kotak Institutional Equities.

“AMCs under our coverage have corrected 15- 25 per cent over the last five months on fears of adverse changes to AMC TERs. However, the expected impact on earnings is lower than previously feared and we expect the stocks to see a bounce back once further clarity emerges on the proposed regulations and expected impact is further crystallised,” added JM Financial."

81	HDFCAMC	HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd	We expect earnings growth to be in mid-teens for AMCs: Pankaj Pandey	"""From a commodity perspective, we are positive on two things. One, cement, because the benefit of lower coking coal prices or coal prices will start reflecting from Q2 onwards. Most of your tier I companies have reported very impressive volume growth , so that is one space which we are liking which should benefit from the overall commodity decline,"" says Pankaj Pandey , Head Research, ICICIdirect.com.When we look at some of these ancillary or subsidiaries companies of banks, so our clear focus is largely towards banks because we have tried insurance companies, we have tried AMCs and also even credit card companies. The growth trajectory is still not very clear and so that is where the challenge lies. So, for example, in case of AMC, while the SIP inflows are good, we would expect earning growth to be in mid-teens and that should help the overall market to do well and eventually leading to better AUM for most of the AMCs.But the challenges are still there in terms of regulatory, so which is why if you have to play, banks are a better bet. So, I will play it through HDFC Bank rather than playing it individually through HDFC AMC or HDFC Life . So, if I have to ride that opportunity, banks are offering a slightly better option compared to chasing individual names.From a commodity perspective, we are positive on two things. One, cement, because the benefit of lower coking coal prices or coal prices will start reflecting from Q2 onwards. Most of your tier I companies have reported very impressive volume growth, so that is one space which we are liking which should benefit from the overall commodity decline.The other is the autos because autos in general will benefit from that. Another segment which we like is the tile manufacturers. Volume growth is expected to be 12-13 odd percent. We have seen gas prices correcting and most of these players have yet to witness peak margins.So, for example, Kajaria, the peak margin used to be about 20 odd percent. We are still looking at 16% kind of a margin in terms of numbers. Volume growth is good because Morbi players are largely exporting and not really dumping domestically, so price discipline is also better and overall real estate as a segment is also shaping up well. So, this is one space where we like both Kajaria as well as Somany Ceramics When we look at traditional pharma exporters, so while for a company like Aurobindo Pharma, US contributes 46%, the specialty portfolio has done well for them. But even if you take into account all of that, you will see decent top line and bottom line growth. But the ROEs are still subdued at about 10 odd percent so which is why while it trades cheaper 10, 11, 12 times but we are not comfortable in terms of recommending.What we like is more of CRAM or companies like Divi’s. So, while the gross margins have declined from 67% to 60%, but our sense is that in the subsequent quarters things are improving, companies are guiding for higher level of inquiries, so things are improving there and which is why Divi’s despite it trades at 10 times sales we are comfortable recommending that stock even at current levels.What we like is Torrent Pharma because Torrent Pharma trades at nearly about 28-29 times, so a bit expensive, but agood portion of the top line is coming from the domestic side, after a long period of time company is guiding for higher EBITDA margins and that will improve the ROCE and also our sense is that possibly could lead to better multiples.So, while the stock has run up, but we still feel that this is one of the better stocks to look at on the domestic side because their productivity or various parameters when you look at they have been delivering far more better growth compared to a lot of other domestic oriented names.Valuations are definitely attractive in the tier I space. So, for example, Infosys is trading at 15% below their long-term average while the growth is still expected to be soft at about 6% to 8% odd kind of a constant currency growth, a lot will depend on how things pan out in the US in the subsequent quarter, so it is a good contra play to be looked at.But when that upside will come it is very difficult to put a number to it because we are still looking at probability rate hikes in US.But I think tier II names, say for example, something like Newgen Software which has got a very balanced revenue profile and is comfortable delivering double-digit growth, it looks better.Similarly, when you look at even the other tier II names be it Persistent or be it Coforge , these companies are comfortable guiding for decent double-digit growth, so that is the space we would look at. While we like them, but we do not know by when or how would be the trajectory going forward in terms of price performance."

84	IDEA	Vodafone Idea Ltd	Pesky calls: Telcos to roll out platform to take consent of users in 2 months	"Soon unwanted mobile phone calls and SMS could become a thing of the past. Telecom operators, including Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, are setting up a new platform to take consent of users who want to receive calls and messages only from specific businesses such as their banks, stock brokers and vendors, while blocking other telemarketers.

This comes after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a circular to all telecom operators to develop and deploy a unified platform called the Digital Consent Acquisition (DCA) facility. The system will allow telecom operators to block all calls and messages that the user has not consented to receive. TRAI expects to develop such facilities within two months.

The new system is an improvement on the existing platform. For example, in the existing system, consent is maintained by third-party principle entities, such as banks, financial services companies, and hospitals etc, which means telecom operators are unable to check for the veracity of the consent, and users cannot revoke consent using a unified framework.

Also read TRAI must be careful while allocating spectrum to LEO players: Dish TV

Under the Do Not Disturb (DND) system users’ consent was given as a default and they had to apply to put their phone numbers under the DND list.

“Even after putting phone numbers under DND, users were getting pesky calls because the telecom operators were not checking. Brands that were using third-party telemarketing agencies were also not looking if they were scrubbing against the DND list before calling. The DCA process will have the facility to seek, maintain and revoke the consent of customers. The consent data thus collected will be shared on a Digital Ledger Platform for scrubbing by all telecom operators thus ensuring that consumers receive calls from businesses only if they give prior consent,” said an industry expert.

Fiat to telcos

TRAI has directed telecom operators to develop and deploy DCA as a priority. In the first phase, only subscriber-initiated consent acquisition has been permitted by TRAI. Subsequently, companies can directly seek consent.

“Initially, principal entities belonging to the banking, insurance, finance and trading-related sectors shall be on-boarded to initiate consent acquisition process and the remaining sectors shall be onboarded subsequently,” TRAI said in a circular.

84	IDEA	Vodafone Idea Ltd	Satellite spectrum: Tech firms united, telcos divided on allocation | The Financial Express	"Tech firms like Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, Telesat, Tata Group’s Nelco, Hughes and Bharti Enterprises OneWeb have taken a united stand and told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that spectrum for satellite communication services should not be auctioned. In contrast, telecom operators are divided with Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea pressing for auctions and Bharti Airtel arguing against it.

Trai is carrying out a consultative process on the matter and all stakeholders have responded to the discussion paper on the subject. The Authority will now hold public consultations before finalising its recommendations.

“Trai’s choice of spectrum assignment process must recognise that when it comes to shared spectrum use by satellites, the triple benefits of increased competition through numerous operators, maximisation of consumer choice, and revenue optimisation are all fundamentally aligned,” Starlink said in its comments on the consultation paper.

“Auctioning spectrum used for satellite services in the higher frequency bands would block other potential users and artificially limit competition to only a few players. Auctions can also result in higher prices for customers, as winning bidders pass through their spectrum acquisition on costs,” said Amazon’s Kuiper.

Countering such views, Jio and Vodafone have said that there should be same rules for assignment of spectrum for satellite and terrestrial networks as they compete with each other. “It can be established from various reports that services providers such as SpaceX, OneWeb, Kuiper, Telesat have an intent to create broadband communication services which would compete with terrestrial broadband services,” Jio said, adding that their explicit intention is to instigate competition with terrestrial networks and no preferential treatment should be given to them.

On the argument that satellite spectrum is used in a shared manner, Jio said due to the widespread geographic distribution of user terminals, it would be unfeasible for terminals deployed by different service providers to operate on the same frequency. The satellite spectrum in the band of 27.5-28.5 GHz is key for offering internet services in the far-flung areas.

Vodafone Idea said, “28 GHz band has already been assigned for IMT/5G in many countries including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and US, and the same should also be made available in India for 5G/IMT to enable mobile operators to acquire adequate quantity of spectrum, to support present and future needs of variety of use cases.”

Four countries — Brazil, Mexico, the US and Saudi Arabia — had come up with competitive spectrum allocation for space communications. But Brazil, Mexico and the US later discontinued the auction system due to impracticality.

Bharti Airtel, which is part of Bharti Enterprises, the promoter of OneWeb, said, “The auction of orbital slots done in a few countries should not be confused with the auction of spectrum for satellite services.”

According to Airtel, in an auction-based scenario, competitive forces can block spectrum capacity and hoard it. This will lead to non-utilisation in areas where another operator (who has a global assignment for the same spectrum) could have used it.

On Jio and VIL’s argument of same rules, the Broadband India Forum (BIF) said the current annual revenue of Indian mobile operators is about `2.5 trillion whereas that of the Indian satellite VSAT operators is only around `500 crore.

“Satellite services are therefore as miniscule as 1/500th or a mere 0.2% of the mobile operators’ revenue. It would be a travesty of justice to equate the two in treatment of mode of allocation of spectrum resource,” BIF added.

Satellite companies also rejected the argument that the Supreme Court’s 2012 order mandates auction, and said the 2G judgment was specific only to the allocation of spectrum from September 2007 to September 2008. It was in response to a Presidential reference and the court was not talking about auction in general.

Various industry bodies such as Indian Space Association (ISpA), Nasscom, Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT), India Cellular and Electronics Association, among others, have called for administrative allocation of satellite spectrum to protect the nascent space industry from huge competition."

84	IDEA	Vodafone Idea Ltd	Jio, VIL pitch for Satcom spectrum allocation via auction, Airtel opposes	"While the satellite industry has unanimously demanded spectrum allocation through administrative methods, major telecom firms Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel offered divergent views to sector regulator Trai.

The comments on a consultation paper on spectrum assignment for space-based communication by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India were made public on Friday.

Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea (VIL) have suggested that the spectrum for satellite communication services should be allocated through auction, while Bharti Airtel has opposed it.

Reliance Jio has submitted that spectrum assignment between space-based and terrestrial networks must maximise public good and serve the greatest number of people.

""There is no better method than free and fair auctions to achieve this goal. Auctioning spectrum is the most transparent method of spectrum assignment and allows service providers to decide on their technology, be it terrestrial, satellite, or any other,"" Reliance Jio said.

It also said that the Supreme Court has unambiguously declared that the right to use such spectrum can only be transferred through a transparent auction and only the Apex Court can alter this policy on spectrum assignment.

VIL said the spectrum from 27.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz (including 27.5 GHz to 28.5 GHz) should be put to a fair and transparent auction in line with the Supreme Court Judgment of 2012 and the principle of same service same rules.

Bharti Airtel said that the auction of satellite spectrum will put Indian players at a disadvantage in comparison to the global competing operators, who simply pay an administrative fee for the resources required for providing the same service in other global markets.

""Airtel is concerned that auctioning the satellite spectrum and creating an exclusiveness will create barriers for competition as competitors may block access to it by bidding and winning partial or full spectrum in spite of having no such global allocation, and make satellite systems redundant and severely hamper the emerging space ecosystem in the country,"" it added.

The company said that the auctioning spectrum and then creating a sharing mechanism is self-defeating.

""It is akin to bringing an intermediary between the spectrum licensor and user licensee: There is no need to create a middle-entity (an intermediary) between the spectrum licensor...the satellite operators,"" Airtel said.

It added that such an intermediary will have to initially buy the spectrum from the DoT and then, through a mandatory sharing mechanism, offer the same spectrum to actual satellite spectrum users.

""This will bring in needless complexities since user satcom players will have to stitch multiple sharing arrangements together with different spectrum winners or owners,"" Airtel said.

Space industry body Indian Space Association (ISpA) said any step towards the auction of the spectrum for satellite services will represent a retrograde step away from fulfilling these objectives.

""The features of satellite spectrum make them unsuitable for an auction process,"" ISpA said."

87	INDIANB	Indian Bank	Special Benefits for Super Senior Citizens: Higher Interest Rates and More on Fixed Deposits	"In sync with the wealth of experience and wisdom that accompanies their years, super senior citizens, i.e., those 80 years and above, can look forward to preferential interest rate on bank fixed deposits in select banks. Besides, they may also enjoy liquidity in the form of overdraft facility, waiver on premature penalty charges, and other facilities. Here is a lowdown.

What’s on offer

RBL Bank, Union Bank of India, PNB and Indian Bank offer higher interest rates on FDs opened by super senior citizens.

RBL Bank’s Super Senior Citizen fixed deposits offer preferential interest rate of 75 bps (basis points) p.a. for all tenures (7 days to 20 years).

Likewise, Union Bank of India offers additional rate component to resident super senior citizens on term deposits up to ₹5 crore in all of its domestic term deposits scheme. The additional rate component applicable to resident super senior citizens is 75 bps over and above the normal rate displayed above (25 bps over and above rate applicable to resident senior citizen).

PNB offers super senior citizens an additional rate of interest of 80 bps over applicable card rate across all maturity buckets. In case of staff members as well as retired staff members who are also super senior citizens, maximum rate of interest to be allowed over applicable card rate is 180 bps over applicable card rate across all maturity buckets.

In case of Indian Bank, there are two ways in which super senior citizens can get extra interest. One, special deposit scheme ‘IND Super 400 Days’, which has been extended till June 30, 2023, offers super seniors 8 per cent (75 bps over public rates and 25 bps over senior citizen rates). Two, ‘IB – Golden Ager’ special term deposit account for super senior citizen offers additional 25 bps higher rate of interest over and above the additional rate that is presently being offered for normal senior citizen on term deposit for all deposit buckets. The minimum tenure is 7 days and maximum is 10 years.

On a different note, Central Bank of India offers ‘Cent Super Non-Callable Time Deposit for 444 days’ scheme where super seniors can get 100 bps and ex-staff super seniors can get 200 bps more interest, according to their website. While premature withdrawal is allowed, it will attract penalty of 2.5 per cent on the applicable rate of interest for running period of the time.

Paperwork involved

To be eligible for schemes for super senior citizens (age 80 years or above), one has to show age proof as on the date of opening of account. Any valid KYC document containing age/date of birth as per existing KYC policy of RBI can be accepted as proof of age. Birth certificate or any other valid proof containing age/date of birth can also be accepted as proof of age by banks.

The higher rate for super seniors is typically on domestic term deposits below a certain level (₹2 crore/10 crore) depending on the bank. Typically, super senior citizen rates are not applicable on non-resident deposits (NRE/NRO), though some special schemes may allow non-residents. Super senior FDs can be opened through online/offline mode.

Some banks allow super senior citizens to take advantage of special deposit schemes if account is self-only operated (no joint account allowed). This could prove to be problematic if the super senior suffers from health issues now or in future, and is not able to operate the account on his/her own.

While banks such as RBL may not charge premature withdrawal penalty, ‘IB - Golden Ager’, according to their website, levies charges as applicable to normal deposits if there is premature closure. Such charges could shave away the incremental return on special schemes if there is premature closure. Hence, super seniors should only park deposits in these schemes that in ordinary course of business wouldn’t be needed.

Super seniors may get liquidity with Overdraft (OD) facility upto 90 per cent of the principal value on super senior citizen FDs. But do look at the rate of interest on the OD. A rate of 2 per cent over the interest paid on deposit could be charged for OD.

Super seniors should note that in case any ongoing special deposit scheme for them is discontinued, the deposits maturing thereafter placed under the special product could automatically be rolled over to general senior citizen product under the respective maturity bucket."	"What’s on offerRBL Bank, Union Bank of India, PNB and Indian Bank offer higher interest rates on FDs opened by super senior citizens.
RBL Bank’s Super Senior Citizen fixed deposits offer preferential interest rate of 75 bps (basis points) p.a.
PNB offers super senior citizens an additional rate of interest of 80 bps over applicable card rate across all maturity buckets.

The Finance Ministry has asked insurance companies to give an update on the steps they are taking to expedite the claim settlement process for victims of the triple train crash in Balasore district of Odisha on June 2.

In an email to non-life insurance companies, the General Insurance Council has said that it has been receiving “frequent calls from the additional secretary, department of financial services, Ministry of Finance.”

The inquiries pertain to claim settlement process for passengers who may have suffered injuries or died due to the accident, one of the worst rail mishaps that India has witnessed.

They have been asked to provide updates on the steps being taken to proactively identify the victims.

“Some members would have tied up with IRCTC and PMSBY (Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana) to offer accident insurance to the train passengers. You are requested to please inform the council urgently whether you have underwritten accident insurance policies in a tie-up with IRCTC and PMSBY and the steps you are taking in proactively identifying the victims and ensuring that their claims are settled expeditiously,” the GI Council's email to insurers, a copy of which Moneycontrol has accessed, says.

PMSBY provides insurance against death or disability due to accidents. The sum assured – which will be the claim amount to be paid out – in case of death is Rs 2 lakh.

In case of total and irrecoverable loss of both eyes, hands or feet, the maximum claim amount is Rs 2 lakh. If the accident victim were to completely lose sight in one eye or use of one hand or foot, the claim amount is restricted to Rs 1 lakh.

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) also offers travel insurance through several general insurance companies. Passengers have to opt for this policy at the time of booking rail tickets through the IRCTC portal. The sum assured for death and permanent total disability is Rs 10 lakh, but restricted to Rs 7.5 lakh in case of permanent partial disability.

Upon hospitalisation for treatment of injuries, the policy will hand out Rs 7.5 lakh. The coverage also includes claim settlement of Rs 10,000 for transportation of mortal remains.

“IRCTC will have the list of passengers who had purchased insurance, which insurance companies can use to settle claims. In addition, companies are simplifying other requirements and waiving off the need to produce certain documents. For instance, in this case, there is no need to prove that an accident has taken place – that is known. Usually, an accident report and first information report (FIR) are needed for the claims to be processed. These are being waived off,” said a senior industry official in the know of finance ministry and General Insurance Council’s actions.

All insurance companies – life and non-life - are in the process of finalising their plans to ease requirements for settling claims linked to the mammoth tragedy.

The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) issued a statement on Saturday, announcing its decision to ease claim processing norms. A list of casualties published by the Railways, police or any state or Central authorities will be accepted as proof of death instead of registered death certificates, it said."

95	INFY	Infosys Ltd	Salary of Infosys CEO Salil Parekh drops 21% to Rs 56.45 crore in FY23	"

Parekh's remuneration consists of base pay, retiral benefits, and fixed salary. In addition, he also receives the value of stock incentives exercised during the period and any incentives or variable pay. The Bengaluru-based IT services company, Infosys’ annual report showed that chief executive officer (CEO), Salil Parekh’s compensation for the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) took a drop of 21 per cent at 56.45 crore, down from Rs 71 crore in the previous year.



RSUs are a type of equity compensation offered to employees. Infosys provides RSUs through two plans. Under the 2015 plan, stocks are vested mainly based on time, while the 2019 plan's benefit is based on performance. Performance indicators include total shareholder return and the company's operating metrics. This decrease appears to be due to Parekh exercising fewer restricted stock units (RSUs) during the year.



In FY23, Parekh received a base pay of Rs 6.67 crore, retiral benefits of Rs 45 lakh, and a variable pay of Rs 18.73 crore. His variable pay increased to 18.73 crore in 2023, from Rs 12.62 crore in 2022. Out of the total compensation of Rs 56.45 crore, Parekh earned Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. In the previous fiscal year, he earned Rs 52.33 crore from exercising his RSUs, making him one of India's highest-paid CEOs, according to Moneycontrol.

However, Parekh was not the highest-paid executive at Infosys. That distinction belonged to President Mohit Joshi, who resigned in March and will take over as the CEO of Tech Mahindra. Joshi earned Rs 57.32 crore in FY23 and will leave Infosys on June 9. Moneycontrol added that Parekh's remuneration was 627 times higher than the median remuneration of Rs 9 lakh received by the company's employees.

95	INFY	Infosys Ltd	ROI on AI investments a concern for businesses: Infosys AI head	"As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has picked up significantly across industries, return on investment(ROI) is one of the major concerns organisations have, given that major investments are being made, said Balakrishna D. R., Executive Vice President – Global Head, AI, and Automation and ECS, at Infosys.

“As there are immense possibilities with AI, navigation through it and making sure there is a reasonable return on investment is one of the major concerns businesses have. This is because there is a significant investment in infrastructure, software, and personnel,” Balakrishna told businessline.

“Implementation of AI in a scalable way in order to control cost and increase ROI is being looked at. Companies should rather have a platform-based approach for democratized use, as the cost of independent use cases is high. Protection of data and intellectual property(IP), and building expertise to keep up with rapidly evolving technologies, are the other concerns.”

Infosys has seen enhanced demand for its AI services, thanks to the interest Chat GPT was able to unleash, said Balakrishna. The company has developed over 12000 AI use cases across different industries and horizontals and has 150 pre-trained models. Infosys provides technology services, generative AI services, conversational AI, and transactional AI services, along with various industry-specific services and solutions.

Balakrishna said that the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), along with automotive, retail, and healthcare industry verticals have been the frontrunners in AI adoption. He said that various other industries too are catching up now as multiple use cases are being seen across segments. AI is one of the fastest-growing services across the company as it is getting high traction, he added.

Topaz - Generative AI

Infosys recently launched Topaz, an AI-first offering to accelerate business value for global enterprises using generative AI. Balakrishna said, “It is a big market opportunity, and the potential is quite high. We see significant market traction, and we have a repository of use cases built specifically for generative AI.”

The new offering comes at premium pricing in multiple ways as it requires a specialised skill set. Albeit, even from the outcome perspective, it is premium as tasks using AI can be done much faster and with better efficiencies and value, and customers are willing to pay for the same, he added."

97	IOC	Indian Oil Corporation Ltd	‘You have opened nafrat ka mega shopping mall’: JP Nadda counters Rahul Gandhi’s remarks in US	"BJP National President JP Nadda on Monday attacked former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, saying he is not spreading love but has opened a mega shopping mall of hatred. ""You have opened a mega shopping mall of hate,"" Nadda said in a sharp attack on Rahul Gandhi, who is currently touring the US.

Addressing an event, Nadda said that nine years of the Modi government transformed the country and its progress was being recognised by the world today. There is a massive difference between the times before and after 2014 when the Modi dispensation assumed office.

""But whenever India sets new records, the 'yuvraj' of Congress cannot digest India's pride,"" he charged, in an apparent reference to Gandhi. ""On the one hand, he raises questions on the surgical strike, talks about dividing Hindu-Muslim and on the other hand he says that he is running 'mohabbat ki dukan' (shop of love)...You are not running any 'mohabbat ki dukan'. You have opened 'nafrat ka mega shopping mall',"" the BJP president said after launching a book titled ""Amrit kaal ki aur"" (Towards Amrit Kaal), which is an account of the nine years of the Modi government.

#WATCH | Whenever people believe in India's leadership, then Rahul Gandhi has a problem with it. You (Rahul Gandhi) say that you are running a shop of love, you are opening a mega mall of hatred: BJP National President JP Nadda on Rahul Gandhi's statements pic.twitter.com/jgdkC3ZOOU June 5, 2023

Nadda said he was not saying it for the sake of making political statements. He then asked, ""Who was standing with the forces that said: Afzal Hum sharminda hai, tere kaatil zinda hai?"". He also suggested that it was the Congress leader who was backing the ""tukde-tukde gang"".

The BJP chief's attack comes just days after Rahul Gandhi addressed an event 'Mohabbat Ki Dukaan' in America's Santa Clara. The event was organised by the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC). During his address, Gandhi targeted the Modi government, saying it was misusing all the agencies. He also said that India was being run by a group of people who are 'absolutely convinced' they know everything.

“They could sit down with God and explain things...and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one such specimen,” he said. He said that there is a ""group of people who understand everything...they can explain science to scientists, history to historians, warfare to the Army, and at the heart of it is mediocrity. They actually don't understand anything.""

“They have the media. They have captured institutions. They put pressure on all the institutions. They threaten people...so, their voice is heard more,” the Congress leader said.

100	JSWSTEEL	JSW Steel Ltd	Tata Steel, JSW, JSPL and SAIL: How have they fared on key metrics and which stock should you buy?	"If FY22 was a year of rally in steel prices, FY23 witnessed a similar rally in input costs that impacted the spreads (between realisations and costs). In Q4FY23, steel prices continue to be flattish, but from the inflated base in FY23. The peak commodity costs are most likely behind in FY23 and the medium term will continue to be volatile. We examine the two dynamics and its impact on the bullish capex cycle the companies are currently engaged in.

Steel prices hold stead

Steel price realisations across the four leading companies (Tata Steel, SAIL, JSW Steel, and Jindal Steel) gained 35-68 per cent in FY22 as easy monetary policies post-Covid and shortages in production drove realisations. The following year saw a flattish performance ranging from -6 to 4 per cent gain in FY23 as the rally lasted well into the first half of FY23. In the most recent quarter, steel prices corrected but only by an average of 5 per cent across the four compared to FY23 prices, essentially retaining the high base despite modest corrections (see graph). This new base of realisations is 40 per cent higher than FY21.

With expectations of recession in Europe and a slowdown in economic activity in China, factors for strong price growth from the current base cannot be expected. However, offsetting the lack of positive price triggers are supply-side constraints in international steel markets. Europe and even China, accounting for 60-70 per cent of production and demand are facing environmental choke on production. This is either in the form of carbon costs or curtailed manufacturing activity. The higher commodity costs on top of environmental costs are adding downward pressure on industry profitability. The lower utilisation of Russian and Ukrainian steel facility is also adding to price support internationally, despite dampened economic outlook.

Domestically, the removal of export duty and lower Chinese imports is supporting recovery in steel prices to around ₹60,000 per MT (hot rolled coil prices) in April-2023 from a low of ₹55,000 per ton in late CY22. The National Infrastructure Plan will further support prices of core commodities, including steel domestically, along with the current rebound in real estate activity. However, one thing to note is that high interest rates can impact the prospects if inflationary concerns are not addressed.

Input cost inflation

Raw material costs per ton doubled between FY21 to Q4FY23 (94 per cent increase), but is gradually declining. Coking coal, which is the primary input cost has come off from $550 per ton last year to $275 per ton currently. Compared to the average for the whole of FY23, the last quarter’s (Q4) RM cost per ton was lower only by an average of 4 per cent across the four companies as the lower costs will be reflected with a lag. EBITDA per ton has improved by 56 per cent QoQ across the four companies gaining from lower raw material costs in Q4FY23. The medium-term outlook though, is hinged on geopolitical outlook and cannot be estimated. The companies have indicated a 4-5 per cent increase in coking coal costs in Q1FY24. But in the long run, the spreads should improve as the decline in realisations is expected to be slower than the decline in raw material costs.

Capex thrust

The Indian companies are on a high capex cycle. Tata Steel is looking to spend ₹16,000 crore in FY24, SAIL ₹6,500 crore, JSW Steel 49,000 crore in three years, and Jindal Steel ₹7,500 crore in FY24. The strong infrastructure push from the government, lower exports from China, restricted supply in Europe, and resulting higher realisations underline the investment plans. Any improvement in input commodities posts geopolitical conflicts should aid the higher capacities with higher spreads. Compared to earlier capex cycles, the companies are at a far better and more comfortable debt position currently with net debt to EBITDA ranging from 0.8 (Jindal Steel) to 3.8 times (SAIL).

101	JSWENERGY	JSW Energy Ltd	2 top stock recommendations from Sudeep Shah	"""I feel we can see this consolidation going in for another day or two. And then we could see another leg up on the upside. So, overall what I feel is that 18530-18500 zone will now act as a strong support because we have seen some decent amount of put writing happening in 18500,"" says Sudeep Shah SBI Securities.Yes, right. what we are noticing in the index today is that Nifty is trading in plus minus 20-25 points band and that is quite obvious and quite okay after such a big up move. Index is trying to consolidate at higher levels. Now, yesterday we have seen Bank Nifty also crossing and surpassing its previous lifetime high and it is now managing to sustain above that.So I feel we can see this consolidation going in for another day or two. And then we could see another leg up on the upside. So, overall what I feel is that 18530-18500 zone will now act as a strong support because we have seen some decent amount of put writing happening in 18500.So, 18500-18530 will act as a strong support on the upside. I feel that index could witness 18680-18700.The first recommendation that I have today is Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, HAL. Now we have seen this stock since last seven-eight months, it is in a structural uptrend. There is an intermediate correction but those corrections are always bought into say around 13-day exponential moving average always acts as a support. This time also post that move to 3150 index HAL has retested this 2980-3000 mark which was its 13-day exponential moving average and post that once again we are seeing an uptick today.Even BEL is showing some positive signs. So, I feel HAL from the current levels can be bought with Rs 3050 stop loss and Rs 3200 target.Now, the second pick would be Dalmia Bharat. Now, we are seeing some momentum shift in cement stocks since last few days. And today, Dalmia Bharat has given a breakout of the downward-slopping channel that it was trading into since last 10 to 12 sessions.And this breakout is backed with volumes and a rising open interest. So, I feel from the current levels this stock can be bought with Rs 2090 stop loss and a Rs 2180 target on the upside.JSW Energy has been trying to make a bottom somewhere around 200-220 mark in the last two-three months. However, I feel that still the stock is not out of the woods, it is still in a downtrend and only across about 275-280 will mean that the short-term downtrend in the stock is over and then the stock can be bought on dips.Because right now, even though we are seeing today it is up 4-4.5% but generally these rises are met with selling pressure at higher levels. And unless and until that 200 DMA, which is around 280 zone, does not cross, I do not think so that the stock will have any major upside. It might give us 3-5% moves here and there but structural uptrend, I feel would only come in place when it is above 280.The second stock, which you said is Jubilant Pharmova. Now that stock is in a complete downtrend, selling pressure at higher levels is always witnessed. And I feel, till the time 363-370 does not cross on this stock, we might see the stock heading towards 283-290 levels in the next few weeks to come.So, overall, the trend of the stock is negative and I feel we should not be doing bottom fishing in this stock. And if someone is holding it, rises should be used to exit and the money can be shifted into some other outperforming stock."

Nirmal Lifestyle Developers' Rs 790 crore debt is the largest loan up for sale, followed by Supertech's Rs 515 crore debt and Nirmal Lifestyle Malls' Rs 251 crore debt, sources told ET. L&T Finance has initiated a bidding process to sell non-performing loans worth Rs 3,022 crore to asset reconstruction firms, a report by the Economic Times (ET) said. Nirmal Lifestyle Developers, Nirmal Lifestyle Malls, and Supertech are just a few of the ten accounts that these loans are split among.



L&T Finance is making this step as part of its efforts to reduce its wholesale finance book, which comprises both infrastructure and real estate finances. Under the 15:85 structure, the lender is seeking expressions of interest from select asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), with L&T Finance's maximum stake in security receipts (SRs) set at 85 per cent. Bidders interested in participating have till Monday to express their interest.



The corporation has had difficulties in both portfolios. ""We are rapidly selling wholesale,"" said Dinanath Dubhashi, CEO of L&T Finance, adding, ""We don't know which asset we will sell, whether it will be a stage-1 or stage-2, as we hardly have any stage-3 assets in wholesale.""

L&T Finance had a specific structure in mind for real estate that involved a private equity partner, but that arrangement did not get regulatory approval, management informed investors on a recent call.

As a result, L&T Finance has opted to sell assets individually at a discount. The wholesale finance book has now reduced to less than Rs 20,000 crore."

113	LUPIN	Lupin Ltd	Trade setup for Tuesday: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell	"The buying interest in the market amid consolidation continued for yet another session on June 5, backed by auto, select banking and financial services, metal and pharma stocks. Positive Asian cues also aided the northward journey of the Indian equity benchmarks.

The BSE Sensex rose 240 points to 62,787, while the Nifty50 climbed 60 points to 18,594 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with an upper shadow on the daily charts but negated lower highs of the previous three consecutive sessions.

""Technically, this pattern indicates a lacklustre type movement in the market at the highs. The upper area of 18,600-18,700 has been acting as a crucial hurdle as of now,"" Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said.

He says the Nifty's short-term trend continues to be positive with rangebound action.

""The present consolidation movement is expected to continue within a high low range of 18,700-18,500 levels in the next 1-2 sessions. A decisive move above 18,700-18,800 is expected to bring more upside for the near term,"" Shetti said.

Trust an expert when it comes to business and entrepreneurial lessons.Businessman Harsh Mariwala , who has built household brands like Saffola and Parachute, knows entrepreneurship can be daunting, but the passion for building something meaningful always takes over.Taking to Twitter, the Marico Chairman said that founders often work longer hours and undergo many unforeseen hurdles, but their grit will keep them rooted.The 73-year-old shared the top eight mantras from his business lesson manual for the budding entrepreneur.

Feel free to add the learnings you have had along the way,"" he wrote in one of his tweets.Mariwala believes strengths can evolve into passion and determination, which will in turn help entrepreneurs in the future. ""Shaping your future based on these learnings and core strengths, your chances of success would be higher and goals more attainable,"" he shared.While being a jack of all trades may not bring assured success, learning the art of saying 'no' as can help clear up the mind. ""Jack of all trades does not bring success in every field you pursue. By saying, 'no’, you clear up time and headspace to do more. The more focussed you are, the lesser number of tasks you undertake, leading to higher efficiency and quality in your work,"" he added.Failures are not new to Mariwala. In fact, he believes learning comes from failures. ""I have undergone many failures in my journey — and each one of them has taught me something. Sometimes you win. But you never lose. You always learn,"" one of his pictorial posts said.Mariwala believes businesses and startup ideas are often made through chance and serendipity. ""One should remain open to new opportunities and adapt their vision accordingly for sustainable growth. A good businessman will aim to capitalise on the opportunity or environmental change,"" the businessman said.https://twitter.com/hcmariwala/status/1664556187579469831?s=20Learn to be fair, especially when you are in a commanding position.

""Once a certain level of achievement has been attained, it is important to delve into pegging your purpose in life,"" he shared.With passion, perseverance and determination, the entrepreneur can show his grit.""There is a misconception that only ""passion"" is important for success. While ""passion"" brings in energy and drives behaviour, it must be combined with perseverance and determination,"" Mariwala concluded.On Friday, Mariwala also took to LinkedIn to bust the bubble for some people who believe they can get anything they desire in life. He said that one may not be able to get the desired outcome despite diligent efforts sometimes.""You are mistaken if you believe you can simply obtain everything you desire. Life doesn't operate in such a manner. When circumstances favour you, you will surpass your expectations. However, when they don't, regardless of your diligent efforts, desired outcomes may elude you. Remain humble and avoid assuming complete control over your circumstances,"" he wrote on LinkedIn.The businessman said that the only way to succeed is by remaining humble and not assuming who your like or circumstances may turn out."

115	MARICO	Marico Ltd	Marico’s Just Herbs Plans Fivefold Jump In Stores Despite Focus On Breaking Even	"Just Herbs has lined up an aggressive retail footprint expansion plan even as the Marico Ltd.-owned ayurvedic skin and hair care brand aims to break even by March 2024.

The company looks to take its multi-brand store count to 500 from 100 over the next 12 months. The offline expansion plan through multi-brand outlets as well as general trade is part of Just Herbs' renewed focus on physical stores after it was forced to shut all five standalone stores during the Covid-19 pandemic to build a profitable, capital-efficient business.

""We don't want to open any exclusive outlets, at least in the near term,"" Arush Chopra, co-founder and chief executive officer, told BQ Prime. ""The pandemic forced us to recalibrate our offline strategy ... we have consciously decided to have shop-in-shop formats as they don't require heavy capex while at the same time allowing us to be present where our customers are.""

Chopra expects sales from offline channels to contribute about 20% to overall sales by the end of this fiscal, up from 8%. The retailer also expects to achieve break-even faster, buoyed by its rapid store additions.

""Certain lines of the business are already profitable,"" said Chopra. ""For instance, we already make money from our D2C website. But the newer channels are not profitable yet because we are investing in them well ahead of time,"" he said. ""Our DNA is to build a very capital-efficient business ... We hardly raise money compared to our peers. With robust demand and our store addition plans, we hope to achieve breakeven as early as this fiscal.""

Just Herbs currently derives 40–50% of its revenue from its own website.

As against the general trend of a slowdown in discretionary spending hurting businesses, including those dealing with beauty and personal care, Chopra said his company ""does not see a significant headwind from the demand slowdown"" thanks to its relatively inflation-insulated premium portfolio. Interestingly, the non-metros contribute nearly two-thirds of its sales.

""We have constantly doubled our revenues over the past two to three years, and we hope to maintain the momentum, going forward,"" he said, without elaborating further on the Marico-owned firm's financial details.

After skin and hair care, the bridge-to-luxury brand has also forayed into the country's $3.7 billion fragrance market.

The growing demand for natural and organic products and consumers' willingness to spend on premium products present an opportunity for Just Herbs, according to Chopra.

Marico has set a target to reach Rs 450–500 crore revenue in FY24 for its digital-first portfolio, which includes Just Herbs, True Elements, and Beardo.

""The digital-first portfolio has been scaling up well in line with our internal targets. The current portfolio is poised to reach an exit ARR of Rs 400 crore next year,"" said Saugata Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer at Marico, during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""With the funding winter setting in and more sanity in the ecosystem, we'll be able to improve profitability and leverage far more synergies while moving our digital-first brands into their next leg of growth,"" Gupta said.

Marico acquired a 60% stake in Apcos Naturals Pvt., the parent company of Just Herbs, in 2021."	"The company looks to take its multi-brand store count to 500 from 100 over the next 12 months.

116	MAXHEALTH	Max Healthcare Institute Ltd	Movers & Shakers: Stocks that will see action this week	"Short-term bullish reversal

Lupin’s stock bounced off a support at ₹640 towards the end of March. In the subsequent weeks, it gained further ground and particularly, it broke out of the barrier at ₹780 last week. This has potentially turned the short-term trend up. We anticipate a move by the stock towards ₹960 in the coming weeks. But there might be a dip in price to ₹780.

Considering these factors, we suggest going long on the stock of Lupin at the current level of ₹817. Add more longs in case the price softens to ₹780. Place initial stop-loss at ₹740. When the stock appreciates above ₹875, trail the stop-loss to ₹845. Raise the stop-loss further to ₹895 when the price surpasses ₹920. Book profits at ₹960 – a considerable resistance.

Also read: Index Outlook: Uptrend likely to resume in Nifty 50, Sensex

Max Healthcare Institute (₹531.6)

Set to resume the rally

Max Healthcare Institute’s stock, in the second week of May, decisively breached a supply zone between ₹470 and ₹480. It then rallied to hit a record high of ₹564.95 on May 23. However, the stock has seen a decline in price recently. Yet, the major trend is bullish and the stock remains above some key levels. So, the fall in price is mostly likely to be a corrective descent.

We expect the scrip to gain momentum this week. Max Healthcare has the potential to move up towards ₹600 in the coming weeks. Hence, one can buy this stock at the current level of about ₹532. Add more longs if the price moderates to ₹510. Place initial stop-loss at ₹480. Alter the stop-loss to ₹545 when the stock goes beyond ₹570. Liquidate at ₹600.

Olectra Greentech (₹769.7)

Breaches a key hurdle

Olectra Greentech’s share price hit a 52-week high of ₹786 last week before closing the week a little lower at ₹769.7. This has led to the breach of a key hurdle at ₹720, which had significantly improved the chances for the stock to rally further. We expect it to see a corrective decline, possibly to ₹720, and then move up. The nearest notable resistance is at ₹900.

Given the current chart setup, we recommend buying shares of Olectra Greentech at the current level of about ₹770. Accumulate more shares if the price dips to ₹720. Keep the initial stop-loss at ₹670. When the stock moves above ₹825, modify the stop-loss to ₹780. Tighten the stop-loss further to ₹835 when the price goes above ₹860. Exit at ₹890."

126	NESTLEIND	Nestle India Ltd	Unilever and Nestle to appoint new finance chiefs as industry battles inflation	"Francois-Xavier Roger Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg

Nestle SA and Unilever Plc are appointing new chief financial officers, underscoring a changing of the guard at consumer-goods companies as inflation pressures the industry.

Nestle said Anna Manz, the finance boss of the London Stock Exchange Group, will take over from Francois-Xavier Roger when she is released from her current role.

Unilever’s veteran CFO Graeme Pitkethly plans to retire by the end of May next year. He will be working with a new chief executive starting in July as Royal FrieslandCampina’s Hein Schumacher takes over from Alan Jope.

Others in the industry like Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc and Carlsberg A/S are also hiring new bosses. The changes come as the industry faces an existential challenge from a cost-of-living crisis that’s forcing shoppers to tighten their belts and trade down to unbranded products.

The incoming managers will need to stem the erosion of market share without spending too much on advertising or new products, threatening profitability.

Roger and Pitkethly took on their CFO roles just months apart in 2015. During their tenures, the consumer-goods makers both doubled shareholders’ money, when including reinvested dividends.

Roger, 61, helped steer Nestle during a period of impressive growth even as the pandemic caused supply shortages, disruption and uneven demand in recent years.

‘Effective Partnership’

“We are disappointed to see Roger go, as he has built, to our eyes, an effective partnership with Nestle CEO Mark Schneider,” a Jefferies analyst wrote in a note.

Roger helped manage more than 100 deals, including the sale of Nestle’s dermatology business, the purchase of licenses to sell coffee products under the Starbucks brand and the divestment of part of the company’s stake in L’Oreal SA.

The last years of Pitkethly’s 21-year stint at Unilever have been more chaotic. To rebuff a takeover by Kraft Heinz in 2017, the company committed to a margin improvement, aggressively cutting costs and harming its brands. Then it failed to unify its corporate structure in 2018, and last year Unilever made a doomed and much-criticized attempt to buy the consumer-health arm of UK drugmaker GSK Plc.

Despite investor frustration, much of Unilever’s top brass has remained the same, so a broader overhaul is expected after Schumacher starts as CEO."

127	NAUKRI	Info Edge (India) Ltd	‘Bro wouldn’t go to office but book board rooms in Taj’: Twitterati slam Rahul Yadav as Rs 280 cr vanishes with Broker Network	"Rahul Yadav has been termed as the ""enfant terrible of Indian startup ecosystem"" by Twitter users as reports emerged of his lavish lifestyle even as his proptech company Broker Network (operated by 4B Networks) didn't pay its employers for months together.

According to a report in startup news portal Inc42, Broker Network burnt over Rs 280 crore in less than 18 months, while over 150 employees have not been paid since November last year.

Broker Network (4B Networks Private Limited), started in November 2020 by Yadav, was created to enable real estate developers and brokers to communicate with each other and conduct their business through its platform.

Allcheckdeals India Private Limited (AIPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Info Edge, invested Rs 276 crore in Yadav's 4B Networks and provided debt financing of Rs 12 crore.

Now, Info Edge has initiated a forensic audit by Deloitte into the proptech startup in which it holds a stake, as Yadav ""repeatedly failed to provide the information"".

The report had details of Yadav's lavish lifestyle, which included owning a Mercedes-Maybach and hiring a boardroom at Mumbai's Taj Land's End for Rs 80,000 per day.

The IIT Bombay dropout was earlier also caught in the crossfire when he was booted out of his SoftBank-backed venture Housing.com because his behaviour towards investors and media was found to be not 'befitting' of a CEO.

Rahul Yadav tried to deplete Info Edge's shareholding in the company by offering to bring in Rs 50 crore of fresh funds from a Dubai-based property dealer in March-April at a valuation that was 99% lower than its last funding round, according to report by Moneycontrol.

""A leopard cannot change its spots,"" said Amit Gupta, who is from the startup ecosystem, on LinkedIn about the IIT Bombay dropout.

""Yadav’s journey shows a pattern of starting companies, raising funds & then shutting them down (in a year or two). It’s the kind of ‘resume’ that should have attracted questions from Info Edge,"" added Gupta in the LinkedIn post.

Shares of Oil India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) traded marginally higher on June 5 on the back of firm crude prices after Saudi Arabia announced another round of crude oil production cut starting July.

The OPEC nation will cut crude oil supply by 1 million barrels per day.

Brent crude was up by 1.23 percent at $77.07 and West Texas Oil climbed 1.23 percent at $72.61 after the announcement.

Oil India was quoting Rs 255, up 2 percent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the morning trade. ONGC was at Rs 155, up 0.26 percent on NSE.

Oil producers like Oil India and ONGC benefit from higher crude prices as it translates into higher revenues for them. Every $1-a-barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for these two companies, according to analysts’ calculations.

Saudi Arabia had reduced crude production by 500,000 barrels per day in April too. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members including Iraq, UAE, Kuwait and Oman had trimmed crude oil production by a total of 1.16 million barrels per day in April. This was done to increase crude oil prices after the commodity reached lows in March in fears of the US banking crisis, the OPEC said.

OPEC in October had reduced crude oil production by 2 million barrels per day. The total production cut now stands at 4.5 million barrels per day."

128	OIL	Oil India Ltd	OIL starts aerial seismic survey in logistically difficult, hostile areas	"June 03, 2023 04:18 pm | Updated 04:18 pm IST - GUWAHATI

GUWAHATI

Constrained by tough terrains and hostile environments, an oil exploration major has started an aerial seismic survey for locating hydrocarbon deposits beneath strategic stretches across the country.

The Director General of Hydrocarbons has entrusted the Assam-headquartered Oil India Limited (OIL) with the responsibility of prospecting for oil and gas in “unapprised areas” in the northeastern, southern, central, and northern parts of India.

These areas are Nagaland, Manipur, southern Mizoram, North Cachar Hills of Assam, parts of Arunachal Pradesh, the Cauvery basin, Bastar, Satpura, Spiti-Zanskar, and Karewa.

“These areas could not be covered by a seismic campaign on account of various specific reasons such as a logistically difficult terrain, hostile environment, protected areas, and non-availability of in-principle approval for conducting seismic survey operations under the National Seismic Programme,” an OIL spokesperson said.

The technical term for this aerial survey is “acquisition processing and interpretation of 40,000 flight LKM of airborne gravity gradiometry and gravity magnetics (AGG&GM)“.

“The acquisition of the AGG&GM survey started from [eastern Assam’s] Jorhat airbase on May 27. The second aircraft is scheduled to start acquisition from Dibrugarh airport to cover the northeast,” the spokesperson said.

The aerial seismic survey method is a non-intrusive exploration tool with a quick turnaround time that allows for the fastest possible coverage of a large region. It also offers geoscientific value for the overall evaluation of areas covered by a survey, oil experts said.

Seismic surveys use reflected sound waves to produce a scan of the Earth’s subsurface. They can help locate groundwater, are used to investigate locations for landfills, and characterise how an area will shake during an earthquake, but they are primarily used for oil and gas exploration."

130	NMDC	NMDC Ltd	Pricing pressure seen offsetting volume growth benefits for NMDC	MUMBAI: State-owned iron-ores miner National Mineral Development Corporation NMDC ) has cut the prices of its lumps and ores for the second time this quarter, which is seen offsetting some impact of the robust sales volumes the company has seen so far this quarter.The miner has slashed prices by 7-11% last week, in line with the weakness in global iron ore prices, and its total price cuts since late March are now more than 13%. Australia is the largest producer of iron ore in the world, and price of Australian iron ore, which is used as a benchmark, is down nearly 11% month-on-month in May.The majority of the Australian mining output is used by processors in China.NMDC has a production target of 46 to 50 million tonne for the current financial year, up 13-22% as compared to the previous financial year. The company is betting on enhanced efficiencies, monsoons in Chhattisgarh being normal, and the upgradation of the Kumaraswamy mine for this increased output.“If it (Chhattisgarh monsoon) behaves normally then of course we get a greater time for mining, and it really helps us. If the monsoons are affected then the production to the extent of almost around 1.5 to 2 million tonnes is affected,” Amitava Mukherjee , the chairman and managing director of the company told analysts in a recent call.NMDC’s production in April-May so far has been 7.22 million tonne, nearly 14% higher as compared to the previous year, while sales have been more than 22% higher at 7.05 million tonne.“Our April was the biggest April ever… but as of now our progress in May has been much more satisfactory as compared to any of the previous May so Q1 also we expect that we would end up as one of the highest Q1 in the history of NMDC,” Mukherjee said.NMDC’s sales volumes are seen growing in tandem with the production and the company expects NMDC Steel to be major customer with offtake of about 4.5-5.0 million tonne of iron ore per annum once the plant starts functioning at full capacity.The company confirmed that the Nagarnar steel plant will be commissioned by the end of June. Ancillary plants at the site – the coke oven batteries, the central plant, the oxygen plant, and the power blowing station have already been commissioned. The company has spent nearly 23,000 crore as capital expenditure on the plant as on date.“NMDC Steel Limited is going to be one of our permanent and major customers going forward,” Mukherjee said. NMDC eventually plans to produce 100 million tonne of ore each year.Mukherjee, though, said that pricing remains a concern. “…we have been able to hold on as of now but there are several pricing pressures and several headwinds, there is no doubt about that,” he said.The company’s operating profit made on every tonne of ore sold rose more than 46% sequentially to 1,742 rupees in the March quarter, but was 21% on lower on year, largely on account of weaker realisations.For 2023-24 (Apr-Mar), Nuvama Institutional Equities expects the company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to remain flat as the benefit of higher volumes will be offset by weaker prices.

130	NMDC	NMDC Ltd	PSU stocks: SAIL, NMDC, IndianOil & Nalco a play on high dividend yields, brokerages say	"Investors looking for a passive and steady income, along with capital appreciation and wealth creation, go big on dividend-yielding stocks. Such counters are considered to be boring plays as they take a long time to move higher and dividend payout also impacts their stock prices. However, the overall return to the investors remains strong in the long run.

Majorly, shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) are considered to be a high dividend play, while selecting other players from other sectors such as mining and healthcare give a handsome dividend to the investors.

Religare Broking has filtered out 10 high dividend-yielding stocks from the PSU space, with Steel Authority of India (SAIL), NMDC, and Indian Oil Corporation having a dividend yield of more than 10 per cent.

Axis Securities remains positive on SAIL with a target price of Rs 93 as it sees company performance in Q4 to be decent, while BOB Capital and Antique Stock broking have 'hold' ratings for the stock with a target price of Rs 90 and Rs 92, respectively.



ICICI Securities, Motilal Oswal and Sharekhan have a buy rating on NMDC with a target price of Rs 118, Rs 135 and Rs 125 respectively. On the other hand, B&K Securities and Elara Capital have buy ratings on Oil India Corporation with a target price of Rs 109 and Rs 100, respectively.



The dividend yield is one of the main factors to consider when investing in dividend-paying stocks. It is an indicator of the return that investors are earning on their shares. Investors, interested in the dividend income, can consider these stocks for investment, said Religare Broking.

Other dividend-yielding PSU stocks selected by Religare include PTC India, National Aluminium Company, Coal India, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, Power Finance Corporation of India and GAIL (India).



Among other high Dividend yielding stocks, IDBI Capital had picked Hindustan Zinc and Sanofi India in April 2023, with the dividend yield at 25.7 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively. The brokerage saw Swaraj Engines as also a high dividend stock with a yield of 10.4 per cent.

However, the brokerage considered only those companies which had a market capitalisation of more than Rs 800 crore and the company should be profit making for the past 3 years, five-year average ROE should be more than 9.

The benchmark Sensex rose 240 points, or 0.4 per cent, to end the session at 62,787; the Nifty gained 60 points, or 0.32 per cent, to finish at 18,594. The 30-share Sensex is now 497 points, or 0.78 per cent, away from its all-time closing high of 63,284 made on December 1.

The unemployment rate surge in the US was the biggest one-month increase since April 2020. Global markets were muted amid hopes the US Federal Reserve will pause rate hikes in June even as economic data provided conflicting signals. The non-farm payrolls in May in the US rose to 339,000, even as unemployment climbed to 3.7 per cent while wage growth slowed.



The Brent crude rose 1.3 per cent and was trading at $77.12 per barrel (8.50 pm IST) after Saudi Arabia pledged to cut supply. The kingdom’s output will decline to 9 million barrels per day from around 10 million barrels in May, Saudi’s energy ministry said in a statement. It planned further voluntary output cuts which will be implemented from July. “Fed policymakers reconvene for their next meeting on June 16. The market is currently pricing only a 30 per cent chance of a rate increase at the meeting, with the view that the Fed would prefer to skip a meeting before tightening further. We wonder how the Fed will keep its credibility if it doesn't stay the course and raise rates further in June. Since the US central bank’s last board meeting, core inflation has surged above expectations, and the number of jobs created in the past two months has been 40 per cent above market expectations,” said Gary Dugan, CIO of Dalma Capital.

Shares of Oil India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) traded marginally higher on June 5 on the back of firm crude prices after Saudi Arabia announced another round of crude oil production cut starting July.

The OPEC nation will cut crude oil supply by 1 million barrels per day.

Brent crude was up by 1.23 percent at $77.07 and West Texas Oil climbed 1.23 percent at $72.61 after the announcement.

Oil India was quoting Rs 255, up 2 percent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the morning trade. ONGC was at Rs 155, up 0.26 percent on NSE.

Oil producers like Oil India and ONGC benefit from higher crude prices as it translates into higher revenues for them. Every $1-a-barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for these two companies, according to analysts’ calculations.

Saudi Arabia had reduced crude production by 500,000 barrels per day in April too. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members including Iraq, UAE, Kuwait and Oman had trimmed crude oil production by a total of 1.16 million barrels per day in April. This was done to increase crude oil prices after the commodity reached lows in March in fears of the US banking crisis, the OPEC said.

OPEC in October had reduced crude oil production by 2 million barrels per day. The total production cut now stands at 4.5 million barrels per day."

Wipro confirmed the exits in an email.

""Wipro can confirm that Mohd Haque will be leaving the company in June. Ashish Saxena and Gurvinder Sahni have left Wipro to pursue other opportunities,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""We thank them for their years of leadership and contribution.""

143	PRESTIGE	Prestige Estates Projects Ltd	Prestige Estates presales hit record high in FY23; can this real estate stock deliver return?	"Prestige Estates Projects achieved record-breaking annual presales and the highest-ever collections in FY23, with about 60 per cent of sales coming from Bengaluru, followed by Mumbai (21 per cent) and Hyderabad (14 per cent). Bookings of Rs 12,900 crore surpassed Prestige's own guidance of Rs 12,000 crore for the year. The affordable segment accounted for most of the sales, analysts said as they stayed positive on Prestige's prospects given strong pre-sales performance and attractive launch pipeline.

Analysts gave thumbs up to the company's initiative to foray into non-South India markets and have price targets between Rs 540 and Rs 675 on the stock, suggesting a 11-38 per cent potential upside.

Prestige Estates Projects is targeting 25 per cent growth in pre-sales in FY24. In FY24, Prestige Estates Projects plans to launch the next phase in Prestige City Mulund, Prestige Ocean Towers and Prestige Nautilus in Mumbai. In Hyderabad, it plans to launch Prestige City and Prestige Rock Cliff. Also, in Chennai, Pallava Gardens will be launched, which should start contributing this fiscal, Elara Securities said.

Motilal Oswal Securities has a target of Rs 675 on the stock. HDFC Institutional Equities sees the stock at 630. Elara pegs Prestige at Rs 606. Foreign brokerage Jefferies finds the stock worth Rs 560.

The company launched 16.5 million square feet (msf) of residential projects in FY23 and intends to launch at least the first phase of all the projects in the 76 msf pipeline, with a saleable area of 21 msf. It has guided for Rs 15,000 crore of pre-sales in FY24, up 21 per cent YoY.

""The 25 per cent pre-sales jump in FY23 was driven entirely by new geographies of Mumbai and Hyderabad, as Bangalore sales declined. Strong launch pipeline in new locations should drive similar 25 per cent growth in FY24. Stake purchase in Mumbai commercial properties adds to the large Rs 17,500 crore investments in lease assets; with a monetisation likely only when execution gains visibility,"" Jefferies said while maintaining 'Buy' on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 560 from Rs 550 earlier.

Jefferies said the jump in pre-sales should start reflecting in much higher profitability, but likely from FY26.

DB Realty deal, Q1 debt

Prestige Estates recently executed an agreement with DB Realty to acquire the remaining 50 per cent stake at BKC 101 X and Prestige Liberty towers, Mahalaxmi, for Rs 1,200 crore. The company has valued the transaction based on rentals of Rs 300 per sqft and a cap rate of 9.5 per cent. The company expects to generate rentals of Rs 350 per sqft.

The company will now own 100 per cent stake in both these assets and will lead to Rs 1,000 crore of additional rental income, Motilal Oswal said.

""Prestige Estates is set to bear the total cost of Rs 7,000 crore (Rs 4,200 crore of construction, Rs 1,800 crore of premium, Rs 350 crore of rehab and Rs 300 crore of NOC), of which, Rs 3,000 crore is already paid out. With the majority of the consideration already paid out, we do not expect any significant increase in net debt, as a result of this transaction, in 1QFY24,"" it said while suggesting a target of Rs 675 on the stock.

While the recent stake increase in key office assets in Mumbai has resulted in an increase in net debt, Motilal said the enhanced cash flows will support the company in meeting its business development spending and commercial capex requirements without putting strain on the balance sheet.

149	SAIL	Steel Authority of India Ltd	PSU stocks: SAIL, NMDC, IndianOil & Nalco a play on high dividend yields, brokerages say	"Investors looking for a passive and steady income, along with capital appreciation and wealth creation, go big on dividend-yielding stocks. Such counters are considered to be boring plays as they take a long time to move higher and dividend payout also impacts their stock prices. However, the overall return to the investors remains strong in the long run.

Majorly, shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) are considered to be a high dividend play, while selecting other players from other sectors such as mining and healthcare give a handsome dividend to the investors.

Religare Broking has filtered out 10 high dividend-yielding stocks from the PSU space, with Steel Authority of India (SAIL), NMDC, and Indian Oil Corporation having a dividend yield of more than 10 per cent.

Axis Securities remains positive on SAIL with a target price of Rs 93 as it sees company performance in Q4 to be decent, while BOB Capital and Antique Stock broking have 'hold' ratings for the stock with a target price of Rs 90 and Rs 92, respectively.



ICICI Securities, Motilal Oswal and Sharekhan have a buy rating on NMDC with a target price of Rs 118, Rs 135 and Rs 125 respectively. On the other hand, B&K Securities and Elara Capital have buy ratings on Oil India Corporation with a target price of Rs 109 and Rs 100, respectively.



The dividend yield is one of the main factors to consider when investing in dividend-paying stocks. It is an indicator of the return that investors are earning on their shares. Investors, interested in the dividend income, can consider these stocks for investment, said Religare Broking.

Other dividend-yielding PSU stocks selected by Religare include PTC India, National Aluminium Company, Coal India, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, Power Finance Corporation of India and GAIL (India).



Among other high Dividend yielding stocks, IDBI Capital had picked Hindustan Zinc and Sanofi India in April 2023, with the dividend yield at 25.7 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively. The brokerage saw Swaraj Engines as also a high dividend stock with a yield of 10.4 per cent.

However, the brokerage considered only those companies which had a market capitalisation of more than Rs 800 crore and the company should be profit making for the past 3 years, five-year average ROE should be more than 9. Also, it did not consider special dividends (one-off), while consistent Special dividends are considered.

Axis Securities report released in March saw Vedanta as the highest dividend-paying stock, followed by Hindustan Zinc. The stock currently has a dividend pay of 36.26 per cent and 24.62 per cent, respectively.

149	SAIL	Steel Authority of India Ltd	SAIL eyes long-term coking coal contracts with Australia, Russia, US and Canada	"Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is eyeing long-term coking coal contracts across Australia and Russia, while it plans to ramp up production and supply from its own mines in Mozambique, Africa.

SAIL is also in discussions with other coking coal sourcing nations such as the US and Canada for upping supplies.

Long-term contracts generally protect the company from raw material price volatility - primarily upswings – by fixing up the price for the period. It also provides volume protection.

The PSU steel-major will also look to make operational one of its own coking coal mines at Tasra in Jharkhand, with a capacity of 1.6–1.7 million tonnes (mt), over the few years, the company’s Director Finance, Anil Tulsiani said.

According to him, all clearances for Tasra mines have been obtained and the company would look at finalising tenders for appointing mine development operators soon.

Coking coal is a key steel-making raw material and India, despite being the second largest producer of crude steel globally, is also the largest importer of the mineral.

At the moment, SAIL sources nearly 84–85 per cent of its coking coal requirements from Mozambique, Australia and the USAwhile the annual production capacity of the Mozambique mines – which it owns through the International Coal Ventures Ltd (ICVL) – is around 1 mtpa.

Indigenous coal usage is around 15 per cent, sourced mostly from Bharat Coking Coal Ltd and its own mines.

“Some additional capacities beyond this 1 mt we will be sourcing from our own resources in Mozambique. (And the) balance, we will be requiring some more additional coal from Australia, US, and Canada where we will be going in for long term agreements for that. We are also trying to get our coal from Russia now. We have started that (sourcing) also,” he told analysts recently.

SAIL has been importing coking coal at around ₹25,500 per tonne for both the third and fourth quarters (October–March); and the cost is expected to be “bit higher” for the next few months, at around ₹28,000 per tonne.

According to Tulsiani, benefits of lower priced coking coal – following softening in raw material prices - are expected in the “last week of June or early July onwards”.

“The time taken to reach our ports is around about 40-45 days and when it is from Australia it is round about 20-25 days. So, 40-45 days plus the movement inside within India and at the ports. So, the average is around 75-80 days,” he explained.

The steel major saw a substantial jump in expenses, including working capital requirements in FY23 because of provisioning for foreign currency losses caused by an increase in the dollar rate and due to rise in imports of coking coal. “Trade payables are fluctuating a lot depending on the coal prices and we have got these deferred payment terms,” he said.

Mozambique ramp up

Sources in the Steel Ministry said ramp up of operations in Mozambique has been on the cards. SAIL, through ICVL, owns three mines – Benga, Zambeze and Tete East. Of these, only Benga is operational. Saleable coal production in FY22 was 1.74 mt.

However, coking coal produced at Benga is not available as an open market product because of high ash and sulphur. Therefore, back-to-back arrangement with promoter companies for offtake is a pre-requisite before any expansion activity is taken up there.

“Detailed project reports are being prepared for expansion or doubling of operations at Benga, and also for starting operations at Tete East and Zambeze or understanding the viability or technical feasibility of these mines,” a Ministry official said."	"Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is eyeing long-term coking coal contracts across Australia and Russia, while it plans to ramp up production and supply from its own mines in Mozambique, Africa.
SAIL is also in discussions with other coking coal sourcing nations such as the US and Canada for upping supplies.
Indigenous coal usage is around 15 per cent, sourced mostly from Bharat Coking Coal Ltd and its own mines.

151	SBICARD	SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd	SBI Cards and Payment Services to raise Rs 3,000 crore through NCDs	"

In a regulatory filing, the company said, “The board of directors of the company, at its meeting held today, has, inter alia, approved raising of funds by way of issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) aggregating to Rs 3,000 crore in one or more tranches, on private placement basis.” SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, on Monday, approved the raising of funds through the issue of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) up to Rs 3,000 crore.



Profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31 rose 2.7 per cent to Rs 596 crore ($72.8 million) from the previous year, while analysts had expected decline in profit to Rs 542 crore, according to Refinitiv IBES data. In April, SBI Cards and Payment Services reported a surprise jump in its fourth-quarter profit, helped by strong consumer spending which outweighed higher funding costs.



The company, backed by the country's top lender State Bank of India, said the cost of funds rose 185 basis points to 6.7 per cent from last year as interest rates remained high. Net interest margins, a key measure of profitability, fell 170 basis points to 11.5 per cent in the quarter. The strong report card came amid a broader post-pandemic recovery in businesses and consumer spending, and improving asset quality at non-banking financial companies.

151	SBICARD	SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd	Nifty fair value is 20,900: Ambit Capital	"Ambit Capital said that fair value for Nifty is 20,900 by FY24 end, considering March-24 earning yield-bond yield (EYBY) gap. It says that it prefers large-caps over small-cap and mid-cap stocks.

“Nifty fair valuation rises to 20,900 using 7.1 per cent G-Sec yield and March-24 EPS of ₹940 (vs consensus’ ₹991).” it said.

The investment advisory firm has added SBI Cards, Indigo, Affle, Max Healthcare and IndiaMart into its portfolo, while excluding LIC Housing Finance, GCPL and Bank Nifty.

Rate-cut hopes

Nifty upside target is possible if yields sustain at lower levels or March-24 earnings are higher than expectations, Ambit said, adding that “the latter appears unlikely.”

Ambit said banking NIMs would reduce and any decline in policy rates in second-half of FY24 can put more pressure. The overnight index swaps (OIS) curve highlights the possibility of rate cuts over the next few months. Also, the US Fed and the ECB will contract bond supply, impacting liquidity, though India stands out in comparison to peers on macros and can outperform peers, it further said.

“We reduce our 10-year yield assumption from 7.3 per cent as overnight index swap (OIS) curve, real rate and repo G-sec spread indicate yields will stay benign. But we see risk to earnings as the growth engine of Nifty ”BFSI” will slow down in FY24, with contribution to incremental EPS growth tapering (43 per cent) and risks to earnings of IT, Oil & Gas (Reliance) and metals remain,” it cautioned.

Challenges for Reliance, metal

“Tech earnings” remain with expectation of revenue growth normalisation to pre-Covid period. However, delay in China recovery can hit Reliance and metal earnings, it further said.

Ambit Capital’s mid- and small-cap allocations are 12 per cent/5 per cent and cash allocation is 5.2 per cent. “While we retain overweight on banks, we recommend reducing weight as valuations aren’t as cheap as in May-22 and book yield bond yield differential model suggests muted one-year returns,” it advised."

152	SBIN	State Bank of India	Size matters? Humorous SBI Research sidenote on RBI Governors’ height and their policymaking report card	"Ahead of RBI MPC decision on rate hike later this week, State Bank of India’s research department published a study, which found that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governors with short height have proved to be more efficient than their taller counterparts.

SBI’s study was led by economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh. The study, published as a humorous sidenote in prelude to June MPC meeting, showed that the shorter central bank governors have been more effective in controlling inflation or growth and facing macro headwinds than their taller counterparts. In author’s own view, this study should be seen in a lighter vein and not meant to be taken as a substantive finding of any sorts.

“We do not actually believe that performance is determined by height of the RBI Governor, but it is an interesting coincidence, shared on a humorous note,” said SBI while giving a disclaimer to its report.

The state-owned bank evaluated the term of RBI governors in the last 2 decades based on four major factors. These factors include growth to nominal GDP, control in inflation, adverse global economic environment and number of crisis faced (none/single/poly). Overall performance score is equal to the product of score earned in each of the above four factors.

The tallest RBI governor in recent times, 6-foot 1-inch tall Raghuram Rajan, scored a relatively low 85.6 overall on SBI’s index based on the four parameters, hiking interest rates by 75 basis points in his tenure, before slashing them 150 bps in his tenure.

Also, 5-foot 9-inches tall Dr Subbarao scored lowest falling below the performance score of 50. This was mainly because of the extremely high inflation during his term.

However, current RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, who is just 5-feet and 6-inches tall, scored the highest at 108.1 on SBI’s index. Das’ era has seen a steep rate cuts of 250 bps and rate hike of another 250 bps during his term. This has made him the best performing RBI governor among his peers at 108.1 performance score, as per SBI’s research.

Das’ steady leadership came during the challenging and unprecedented times, including the collapse of a major non-bank firm, the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and the inflationary impact arising from the Russia-Ukraine War."	"SBI’s study was led by economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh.

152	SBIN	State Bank of India	RBI MPC meeting on June 6-8: SBI predicts a pause in rate, growth upgrade	"The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Monetary Policy Committee, in the last MPC meeting, had decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, after increasing the rates by 250 bps since May last year. In the upcoming meeting too, scheduled for June 6-8, the State Bank of India believes that the repo rate would remain unchanged once more. It also said that inflation estimates for FY24 could be downgraded.

In its prelude to the MPC meeting, SBI has stated that it expects “RBI to pause in June policy”. It said that it believes that “at 6.50 per cent, we are in for a prolonged pause…”

The report quoted the RBI that said that the pause in rates was a “temporary arrangement”. “With sizeable banking failures across AEs, and a fair probability of contagion spreading across markets despite concerted action from policy makers/regulators to check the same, RBI’s endeavor to sidestep from synchronous rate hike was a courageous gambit, especially since climate risk could upend inflationary projections,” said the SBI report.

“The stance could continue to be withdrawal of accommodation, as liquidity has turned into significant surplus mode,” it further added. Liquidity surplus has increased with the Net LAF absorption at Rs 2.4 lakh crore as on June 1, as compared to a surplus of Rs 2.1 lakh crore at the beginning of the fiscal year. The report added that liquidity is likely to increase further in the coming months owing to the deposit of Rs 2,000 notes.

The report stated that inflation data till October would be decisively below 5 per cent. The prelude added that inflation estimates for FY24 could be downgraded in the June policy. Growth remains strong, it said, further adding that possibility of growth upgrade for FY24 looks imminent.

“The RBI could make a tactical shift in forward market intervention to sell buy swaps… neutralise liquidity and allow Rupee to find its own level…~ $12 bn forward maturity in 3-12 months bucket,” it said.

It also stated that the US Federal Reserve could hike rates in June, and then pause.

Moreover, it declined to issue a forward guidance. “In an environment of rising rates, it is clearly not advisable to give a forward guidance,” the prelude stated.

152	SBIN	State Bank of India	ITC, SBI, Maruti Suzuki among top 5 picks of Axis Securities with up to 23% upside potential	"Domestic equity benchmarks posted marginal gains last week as strong domestic macroeconomic data supported sentiments. The BSE Sensex gained 45 points, or 0.1 per cent to settle at 62,547 during the week ended June 02, while the Nifty jumped 35 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 18,534.

According to Axis Securities, the Indian economy stands at a sweet spot of growth and remains the land of stability against the backdrop of a volatile global economy. It continues to believe in the long-term growth story of the Indian equity market, supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing Capex enables banks to improve credit growth.

The brokerage firm has revised the Dec’23 Nifty target at 20,200 by valuing it at 20x on Dec’24 earnings, implying an upside of 9-10 per cent from the current levels. It believes that the current setup is a ‘Buy on Dips’ market and has come up with 5 large-cap stock ideas with up to 20 per cent upside potential. Do you own any?

ICICI Bank | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,150 | Current Price: Rs 937.05 | Upside: 23%

Axis Securities believes that the bank has been outperforming its peers and has been firing on all cylinders. ICICIB has ticked most boxes on growth, margins, and asset quality.

The brokerage continues to like ICICI Bank for its strong retail-focused liability franchise, buoyant growth prospects, stable asset quality, healthy provision cover, adequate capitalization, and potential to deliver robust return ratios.

Maruti Suzuki| Buy | Target Price: Rs 10,500 | Current Price: Rs 9488.80 | Upside: 11%

According to Axis Securities, the company expects to outpace the industry growth rate led by good order books and new launches (Jimy and Fronx). ""Strong order book, a higher share of premium SUVs, CNG vehicles in the sales mix will improve average selling price in FY24/25; further, improved chip supplies and stable commodity prices will drive the EBITDA growth(higher than earlier estimates) in FY24/25,"" it said.

State Bank of India | Buy | Target Price: Rs 715 | Current Price: Rs 587.20 | Upside: 22%

""Among PSU banks, SBI remains the best play on the gradual recovery of the Indian economy on account of its healthy PCR, robust capitalization, strong liability franchise, and improved asset quality outlook,"" said Axis Securities.



It believes that normalization in the credit costs and the ability to deliver healthy growth should enable the bank to deliver RoA/RoE of 1%/15-17% over FY24-25E.

Varun Beverages | Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,860 | Current Price: Rs 1703.80 | Upside: 9%

Axis Securities believes that the company is well-placed under the current market situation as a strong summer season is expected to drive overall beverage sales across regions. Furthermore, the initial report on possible El-Nino (deficit rainfall) could delay the rural recovery which would lead the entire FMCG pack (ex-ITC) under wait-and-watch mode.

""Hence, in this current volatile market situation, we believe Varun Beverages provides better earning visibility than other FMCG peers in the near term,"" it added.



ITC | Buy | Target Price: Rs 490 | Current Price: Rs 443.20 | Upside: 11%

The brokerage believes that the narrative around the ITC is getting stronger as all its businesses are on the right track – stable cigarette volume growth led by market share gains and new product launches; FMCG business reaching the inflexion point, effective implementation of localisation strategy, driving premiumisation, leveraging technology on demand and supply side; moderation of raw material input cost; strong and stable growth in hotels as travel, wedding, and corporate activities pick up; steady and decent performance in paperboard and agribusiness witnessed in the last few quarters.

153	SHREECEM	Shree Cement Ltd	Shree Cement wins bid for Maharashtra limestone mine	India's third largest cement manufacturer, Shree Cement , has won the bid for a limestone mine in Maharashtra’s Chandrapur district with estimated reserves of 50 million tonne, as per details sourced from a government website.The mine is capable of servicing raw material requirements for a 1.5 million tonne per annum cement manufacturing plant, according to an industry expert ET spoke with.The mine spread over an area of 105 hectares is located at distance of less than 200 kilometre from Nagpur from where multiple supply routes exist to connect with cement plants owned by the company.The auction process was launched by Maharashtra’s state government in February and results declared in the last week of May.A similar mine auction in 2017 for a limestone mine located in Chandrapur was hotly contested with players such as Ambuja, UtraTech and Dalmia said to have participated in the auction. The mine license was eventually won by Ambuja Cement. UltraTech and Ambuja both have cement manufacturing plants in Chandrapur district.Bangur family-promoted Shree Cement has offered to pay 27% of the total value of limestone that is evacuated from the mine. The value is calculated by multiplying the quantity of limestone that is evacuated from the mine and the price of the limestone per tonne that is notified by the Indian Bureau of Mines each month. Payouts have to be made on a monthly basis in addition to which royalties also have to be paid out. Latest available data shows the average monthly prices of cement-grade Limestone were around Rs. 476 per tonne.Generally bidders will quote well under the notified price because they have to factor in the risks and costs of developing the mine.The bidding terms state that the winning concessionaire will have to obtain all environment and forest related clearances. The mines are located close to railheads at Chandrapur and Warora stations but rail sidings will have to be developed by the concessionaire.Shree Cement has cement production capacity in excess of 45 million tonnes per annum. UltraTech and Adani are the only other players with higher cement production capacities.	"The mine license was eventually won by Ambuja Cement.

157	SUNPHARMA	Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd	Sun Pharma to increase R&D investment in specialty and generics businesses	"Global pharma major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has guided for high single-digit topline growth in financial year 2023-24 (FY24), and has indicated that there would be more investments in clinical trials and innovation for its generic and specialty businesses.

This planned increase in spending, the company said, would primarily focus on developing additional indications for its dermatology products Deuruxotinib and Ilumya, as well as conducting additional studies on diabetes drug GLP-1.

“We continue to invest in building research and development (R&D) pipeline for both the global generics and specialty business. Our current generics pipeline for the US market includes 97 Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDAs), an application for a U.S. generic drug approval for an existing licensed medication or approved drug, and 13 NDAs (new drug application) awaiting approval with the US FDA. Our specialty R&D pipeline includes five molecules undergoing clinical trials. In the future, R&D investments are likely to increase both for our specialty and generic businesses,” said Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, in the investor call after the Q4 results.

Sun Pharma’s consolidated R&D investment in Q4 stood at Rs 665 crore, which was 6.2 per cent of sales, compared with to Rs 670 crore or 6 per cent of sales in Q3.

“On the guidance for FY24, we expect high single digit consolidated topline growth for FY24. All our businesses are positioned for growth. Ramp up in our global specialty business is expected to continue. The R&D investments will continue to be 7–8 per cent of sales next year,” Shanghvi said.

In Q4, Sun Pharma’s revenues grew 15.7 per cent YoY to Rs 10,931 crore, EBITDA margins expanded 111 basis points (bps) YoY to 25.9 per cent and adjusted profit after tax (PAT) increased 36.9 per cent YoY to Rs 2,166 crore. The company’s revenue was driven by the global specialty business along with market share gain in India and growth in emerging markets.

Dermatology products Ilumya and Winlevi and ophthalmic product Cequa remained key growth drivers in the US formulations business during the quarter, with global IIumya sales in FY23 standing at $477 million, which translates to a growth of 51 per cent YoY.

Pharma analysts are upbeat on the stock. ICICI Direct maintained a ‘buy’ rating as the global specialty portfolio maintains momentum, growth in India formulations from new launches, field force expansion and revenue mix continues to tilt towards more remunerative businesses. Motilal Oswal said Sun Pharma remains well placed to scale up the specialty portfolio.

“It (Sun Pharma) is also making efforts to introduce new products and develop existing products for alternate indications. While higher R&D spent may affect near-term margins, it would strengthen Sun Pharma’s positioning in innovative products offerings on successful clinical outcome. Niche launches such as like that of g-Revlimid (cancer drug) would enable better sales and profitability prospects in the US generics segment,” said Tushar Manudhane, research analyst at Motilal Oswal.

159	SRF	SRF Ltd	SRF: Why investors should accumulate this stock	"SRF is the largest speciality chemicals company in India. In line with ‘high growth phase’ of the segment, the company reported revenue/EPS growth of 22/35 per cent CAGR in the last five years. Strong domestic demand, increased traction from export clients and India becoming an alternate supplier to China have supported the segment, and the company.

With new products from larger manufacturing base and higher traction from existing and new clients, the company should sustain high growth in its largest segment (chemicals) while retaining margins. The other two segments have faced structural headwinds with contraction in revenue base, and are expected to fare comparatively better in the medium term. We recommend that investors accumulate the stock, currently trading at 30/25 times FY24/FY25 earnings, supported by the chemicals segments.

SRF operates three main segments, led by chemicals business (CB 50 per cent of FY23 revenues). This has the speciality chemicals business supplying active ingredients and complex molecules to innovator agrochemical clients (80-85 per cent from innovators) and fluorochemicals segment that includes refrigerant gases, chloromethanes, and will add fluoropolymers soon. Packaging films business (PFB 35 per cent) and Technical textiles business (TTB 13 per cent) are the other two segments. In the last three years, CB/PFB/TTB have cumulatively contributed 57/30/12 per cent of company EBIT margins.

Chemical business

The speciality chemicals business accounted for 57 per cent of CB in FY23. The division is gaining from increased traction from clients, who are expanding to further downstream and complex products from the original base. SRF has been able to put dedicated plants for such products. The future capex plans include seven plants for speciality chemicals, mainly in agrochemicals, which should be operational in FY24-FY25 (should add 10 per cent to speciality chemicals revenues on commercialisation).

The existing base, with recently introduced products from a multi purpose plant, is also expected to ramp up and add to growth. SRF is expanding into pharma intermediates as well with a pharma intermediates plant ramping up operations. The company is looking to expand into the pharma CDMO (contract development and manufacturing) space with high-value contracts by way of organic or inorganic additions.

Fluorochemicals business is mainly driven by refrigerant gases, which have gained from higher prices following anti-dumping duty in the US on Chinese supplies. Domestic sales have also gained from increased demand from ACs and automobiles space. The US market will face a 30 per cent cut in utilisation of these gases in view of an environmental phasedown. But the company expects the cut extending to production as well, should sustain its export potential. SRF will be adding a new facility by July-2023 for R-32 refrigerant gas.

SRF’s pharma propellant Dymel and chloromethanes have also witnessed strong uptake with ramp-up expected in the latter’s new dedicated plant. SRF entry into fluoropolymers is expected by H2FY24 with the commercialisation of PTFE. SRF intends to start with commodity grade product and later expand to higher grades. The company is also eyeing complex downstream fluoropolymers, including a plant under development at ₹595 crore, which should imply 10-12 per cent revenue contribution in FY25-26 to fluorochemicals.

SRF delivered 42 per cent revenue CAGR in FY21-23 in CB and expects to drive 20 per cent growth in FY24 as well. The segment’s EBIT margin has expanded from 20 per cent to 31 per cent in the period, and SRF expects to maintain the elevated margins as it scales up in complexity and product mix.

PFB and TTB

The two segments are facing structural headwinds, more so for PFB. Owing to higher installed capacity in PFB segment, domestically and internationally, the prices of packing films have declined significantly. The lower pricing should impact sales in the medium term, not only for SRF but for industry itself. With a low margin environment, closure of excess capacity is expected to aid SRF in the longer term.

SRF has also initialised aluminium packaging line (ramp-up in Q2FY24), which completes a full product range in packaging along with international presence for SRF which already operates a value added segments. The industry leading portfolio and support from other business should help SRF last longer in the industry when margin profile improves (EBIT margins declined 16.2 percentage points to 3.2 per cent in Q4FY23 for SRF). The other segment, TTB, is facing lower demand for nylon tyre fabric which is expected to reverse in FY24 while belting fabric is doing well. SRF aims to focus on value-added products for growth.

Financials and valuation

Assuming an arrest in margin decline in the two segments with flat revenue growth in FY24, SRF should be able to drive low double-digit growth in FY24 EBIT profit, driven by chemicals business alone. The industry-wide weakness should lead to reversals in the two segments in the longer run as well. The company intends to spend ₹2,500 crore in FY24 after a similar plan in FY23 and expects to sustain such intensity in the medium term for chemicals segment

The new venture into fluropolymers and pharma intermediates should aid the ongoing growth in chemicals base business (gases and speciality active ingredients) in the longer term. The company has a low leverage ratio of 0.93 times net debt to EBITDA and is expected to maintain the same even in expansion.

162	TATASTEEL	Tata Steel Ltd	Tata Steel, JSW, JSPL and SAIL: How have they fared on key metrics and which stock should you buy?	"If FY22 was a year of rally in steel prices, FY23 witnessed a similar rally in input costs that impacted the spreads (between realisations and costs). In Q4FY23, steel prices continue to be flattish, but from the inflated base in FY23. The peak commodity costs are most likely behind in FY23 and the medium term will continue to be volatile. We examine the two dynamics and its impact on the bullish capex cycle the companies are currently engaged in.

Steel prices hold stead

Steel price realisations across the four leading companies (Tata Steel, SAIL, JSW Steel, and Jindal Steel) gained 35-68 per cent in FY22 as easy monetary policies post-Covid and shortages in production drove realisations. The following year saw a flattish performance ranging from -6 to 4 per cent gain in FY23 as the rally lasted well into the first half of FY23. In the most recent quarter, steel prices corrected but only by an average of 5 per cent across the four compared to FY23 prices, essentially retaining the high base despite modest corrections (see graph). This new base of realisations is 40 per cent higher than FY21.

With expectations of recession in Europe and a slowdown in economic activity in China, factors for strong price growth from the current base cannot be expected. However, offsetting the lack of positive price triggers are supply-side constraints in international steel markets. Europe and even China, accounting for 60-70 per cent of production and demand are facing environmental choke on production. This is either in the form of carbon costs or curtailed manufacturing activity. The higher commodity costs on top of environmental costs are adding downward pressure on industry profitability. The lower utilisation of Russian and Ukrainian steel facility is also adding to price support internationally, despite dampened economic outlook.

Domestically, the removal of export duty and lower Chinese imports is supporting recovery in steel prices to around ₹60,000 per MT (hot rolled coil prices) in April-2023 from a low of ₹55,000 per ton in late CY22. The National Infrastructure Plan will further support prices of core commodities, including steel domestically, along with the current rebound in real estate activity. However, one thing to note is that high interest rates can impact the prospects if inflationary concerns are not addressed.

Input cost inflation

Raw material costs per ton doubled between FY21 to Q4FY23 (94 per cent increase), but is gradually declining. Coking coal, which is the primary input cost has come off from $550 per ton last year to $275 per ton currently. Compared to the average for the whole of FY23, the last quarter’s (Q4) RM cost per ton was lower only by an average of 4 per cent across the four companies as the lower costs will be reflected with a lag. EBITDA per ton has improved by 56 per cent QoQ across the four companies gaining from lower raw material costs in Q4FY23. The medium-term outlook though, is hinged on geopolitical outlook and cannot be estimated. The companies have indicated a 4-5 per cent increase in coking coal costs in Q1FY24. But in the long run, the spreads should improve as the decline in realisations is expected to be slower than the decline in raw material costs.

Capex thrust

The Indian companies are on a high capex cycle. Tata Steel is looking to spend ₹16,000 crore in FY24, SAIL ₹6,500 crore, JSW Steel 49,000 crore in three years, and Jindal Steel ₹7,500 crore in FY24. The strong infrastructure push from the government, lower exports from China, restricted supply in Europe, and resulting higher realisations underline the investment plans. Any improvement in input commodities posts geopolitical conflicts should aid the higher capacities with higher spreads. Compared to earlier capex cycles, the companies are at a far better and more comfortable debt position currently with net debt to EBITDA ranging from 0.8 (Jindal Steel) to 3.8 times (SAIL).

163	TATACHEM	Tata Chemicals Ltd	New products are focused on green chemistry principles, says Richard Lobo of Tata Chemicals	"Tata Chemicals, part of the steel-to-salt conglomerate Tata group, is focusing on green chemistry principles for all its new products. For the world’s second-largest soda ash player with operations in India, Europe, North America and Africa, carbon and sustainability have become vital and 70 per cent of the capacity comes from natural sources, says Richard Lobo, Head Innovation, Research and Development (R&D), Business Excellence and Chief Ethics Counsellor at Tata Chemicals.

Technology started playing a very important role in the way Tata Chemicals started doing business. “We started investing significantly in technology innovation, which is also R&D led, foreseeing new businesses for the future and then making our factories far more sustainable, both from carbon energy and water perspectives,” says Lobo.

For instance, Tata Chemicals’ 80-year-old Mithapur plant is pivoting to becoming a smart factory. The company has put up a connected plant concept and is using analytics, IoT, artificial intelligence, digital twins and more, to track emissions and become sustainable, improve operating efficiency, and lower impact on the environment. “It uses data as an enabler for becoming world class,” says Lobo.

Having a presence in various parts of the world, Tata Chemicals has also started UK’s very first carbon capture plant. “Mainly it’s an amine-based carbon capture technology. It sucks carbon dioxide up to 40,000 tonnes per annum, which is about equal to taking out 20,000 cars from the road, and it converts that carbon dioxide into sodium bicarbonate,” adds Lobo.

The company is also focusing on decarbonisation, redesign, and circular designs and from the R&D side is looking at sustainable renewable solutions and green chemistry for all its products. “100 per cent of our products are now focused on green chemistry principles. And pivoting our future products to market, which are far more sustainable in nature,” adds Lobo. Sharing an example, Lobo said, Tata Chemicals has a product called highly dispersible silica, which goes into tyres.

The company is able to take out the silica from the rice husk cache, which is an agricultural waste. It goes into tyres, which makes them more sustainable. Lobo says, “It delivers better safety on the road because there are grips. The rolling resistance is better and the tire is far more durable. So, it’s 20 per cent longer life. So if a tyre went for 50,000 kilometres, it now goes for 62,500 kilometres. So, in that sense, the product becomes green and sustainable.”

This Highly Dispersible Silica (HDS) grade is being manufactured based on the patented technology developed by the innovation centre of Tata Chemicals. These specialty-grade products are customised for the specific requirements of large customers with support from the innovation centre. The products are sold in domestic and export markets through a combination of direct supply and distributors.

Apart from investing in its own R&D, the company is constantly looking at the best technologies available in the world and adopting them (whenever possible).

Right from coffee plantations to the extraction of metals from lithium-ion batteries, as the Tata group focuses on sustainability; Tata Chemicals is also working closely with other group companies whenever there is a need."

Tata Consultancy Services is helping the airline in service training; Tata Communications with connectivity; and Tata Elxsi in the design of customer touch-points and other heritage and safety centres, he told presspersons of the Hindu Group during a visit to Chennai.

Tata Realty is helping Air India with the new training academy and consolidation of land requirements. Tata Technologies is helping with 3D modelling and design of spare parts that cannot be procured on the market because they are obsolete. “We can manufacture spare parts to keep existing seats workable until we can replace them,” he said.

People from Tata Motors are sharing with the airline how they run procurement, said Wilson. “That’s a real core skill of theirs, and a need that the airline has. We are learning from them how to really run a tight ship on procurement,” he said.

The stock was among the top Sensex and Nifty gainers today after the Tata Group, through its subsidiary, Agratas Energy Storage Solution, inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Gujarat government for its capital expenditure plans in the state. The move will significantly support the development of the electric-vehicle (EV) industry in India.

According to an official announcement by the Gujarat government, the project is set to start with an initial investment of Rs 13,000 crore (equivalent to $1.8 billion) during its first phase. This endeavour aims to establish a factory with a substantial capacity of 20 gigawatts (GW), furthering the government's push towards achieving 100 percent EV adoption and reduction in carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.

On May 26, Moody's Investors Service said it has upgraded its rating outlook on Tata Motors to positive from stable. Moody's has also affirmed the company's B1 corporate family rating (CFR) and its B1 senior unsecured ratings.

“The rating affirmation and outlook change to positive reflect our expectation that the substantial improvement in Tata Motor's credit profile over the past few quarters will sustain over the next 12-18 months,"" said Moody's Senior Vice President Kaustubh Chaubal said.

On May 12, 2023, the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,408 crore in Q4 compared with a loss of Rs 1,033 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, Tata Motors reported a second consecutive quarterly profit, helped by price hikes and strong demand for cars in its luxury Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) stable as well as for commercial trucks.

Abhijeet from Tips2trades said, “Even though Tata Motors stock price has been bullish but it is also overbought on the daily charts with next resistance at Rs 567. Investors should book profits at current levels and wait for a dip near Daily support of Rs 480 to buy for better returns. Immediate support will be at Rs 538.""

JM Financial has assigned a target price of Rs 625 for the Tata Motors stock.

""Strong FCF generation is expected to support higher investments towards electrification at JLR. Tata Motors’ EV portfolio is leading the domestic EV space. Improving margins for both domestic CV and PV segments augurs well for the overall profitability of the company. The company targets to turn net debt free by FY25. Maintain BUY with Mar’24 SOTP of Rs 625 (standalone / JLR valued at 10x /2.5x EV/EBIDTA). Slower ramp-up in production, slowdown in key global markets and inherent risk in evolving EV technologies are the key risks,"" said the brokerage.

Motilal Oswal is bullish on the stock with a target price of Rs 590.

""We upgrade our consol. EPS by 13%/6% for FY24E/25E to factor in: a) JLR’s volume ramp up as well as moderation in certain costs, and b) margin improvements in India businesses. BUY a TP of Rs 590, "" said the brokerage.

On the other hand, foreign brokerage UBS has resumed its coverage on the Tata Motors stock with an anti-consensus view. The brokerage has suggested 'Sell' on the stock with a target of Rs 320, saying the JLR-owner's negatives are overlooked and that positives are largely priced in. UBS said the market is underestimating the rapid electrification of premium cars and JLR that accounted for two-third of Tata Motors' sales and Ebitda in FY23 could be vulnerable going ahead.

167	TATAMOTORS	Tata Motors Ltd	3 top stock recommendations from CA Rudramurthy BV	"""This is not the place to buy fresh. For me risk reward ratio does not favour going fresh longs at current level especially for a short term trader . So I am just taking profits on table wherever it is available. One has to be very careful in terms of valuation and you have to now be cautious on market,"" says CA Rudramurthy BV, Vachana Investments.First off all for market from those levels of 16800 has made this non-stop move towards levels of 18800 so it has been a 2000 point move on Nifty. And in fact Bank Nifty already made its all-time high and it has just consolidating now but let me tell you for me what next is the question, not just what has happened till now. Yes, I was very bullish on market, market hitting all-time highs on Bank Nifty. Nifty matter of just another 100 points but now let me tell you everything is priced in and I am now slowly getting bit cautious on market for very short term.This is not the place to buy fresh. For me risk reward ratio does not favour going fresh longs at current level especially for a short term trader. So I am just taking profits on table wherever it is available. One has to be very careful in terms of valuation and you have to now be cautious on market.It is not time to buy anything but I agree with you in case of some quality mid and small cap, yes still there is lot of space and room left out. And large cap I am not finding any great risk reward trade or opportunity to go on long side. So I am bit cautious on market and I have mid and small cap positions which can do very good which are stock specific but I do not advocate fresh long for trades at current level. So I feel topping out signs for very short term around the corner.One has to be very stock specific and I am picking three stocks out of the big list what you gave so fast. And for me, number one stock in that will be Tata Motors Tata Motors will be the stock of the year. I have been telling this from levels around 400 and even now I am telling it will be the stock of the year.So if I look at chart patterns of Tata Motors, yes post the fabulous result stock just made that move towards 525-530 zones, again consolidated, again now it is breaking out of that level of around 535 and clearly staying above that.So for me, if someone has a long term horizon and at least one year if you can hold Tata Motors or even in F&O take long position and keep rolling over, I would not be surprised to see 700 rupees to come from current level which is another 150 points or another 30% away from current market price.So I am looking at Rs 700 to come on Tata Motors in next one year. And in fact, that is a minimum target, it can even go beyond. And another stock from this list, what you have mentioned I am picking will be India Cements. Look at the chart structure of India Cements , it is now moving into that zone of Rs 225 and once it breaks that level of Rs 225, next halt will only be at Rs 250.And clearly-clearly the stock has given breakout above levels of 200 so any small profit booking or any small dip you get in India Cements, it is not a buy but a great buy. I am looking at targets of 250 plus to come very soon on India Cements.And the third one I pick from your list will be Zee. I know Zee has really disappointing and lot of people know that yes, this stock has lot of value in it, but it has not moved. But this time, I am looking at Zee to give a big, big move on the upside.Initially, those who want to buy at current level, look at levels closer to Rs 230 to Rs 240 to come and post that, I would not be surprised to see Zee going even to levels of Rs 270 to Rs 280. In fact, it is a great-great risk reward buy at current level. I will be a buyer in Zee looking at initial targets of Rs 230-240, eventually Rs 270-280. And I won't be surprised to see Zee even beyond Rs 400 if someone has a good time frame to hold on to Zee.Piramal Pharma is such a wonderful stock to buy at current level. Piramal Pharma is a buy, buy, buy and look at the risk reward. This stock is now going above those levels of around 84-85 and giving me that entry also at current levels. So for me, keep a stop loss of around Rs 70 on Piramal Pharma. And I am looking at target of Rs 140 to Rs 150 which is another 70 to 80% from current market price.And if you see the downside, it is hardly another 10 to 15%. So for me, Piramal Pharma looks a great buy. Look at target of Rs 140 to Rs 150. It is making a rounding bottom formation and it has given a clear breakout above Rs 85. There is a huge volume support as well as delivery buying happening in last one week. Stock is clearly getting accumulated on the chart and it has now given that breakout today.So today this stock sustaining above 84-85 zone confirms to me that yes, the patterns are so-so positive for the stock to move towards Rs 140 to Rs 150 zone. Having a stop loss of 70, it is a great buy.Now let us look at Eureka Forbes. This stock for me after a long time made a base formation at around Rs 350-Rs 360 zone. And then from there a non-stop move towards 500. So for me, if the same Eureka Forbes on chart, if you would have asked me somewhere closer to Rs 370 to Rs 400, I would have told great buy.Even now it is a great buy, but I will wait for an entry. So that great entry can come closer to 450-460 zone. So wait for any profit booking or small dip on this stock.And I will be a buyer in Eureka Forbes, but on a dip towards levels closer to Rs 450 and once it crosses decisively above levels of Rs 540, this stock can go towards Rs 700 to Rs 800 zone.So I will either buy it once it closes above that 540 or on any dip to Rs 450 buy, look at target of Rs 700 to Rs 800. And for this stock, I will have a stop loss closer to Rs 430."	"For me risk reward ratio does not favour going fresh longs at current level especially for a short term trader .
Yes, I was very bullish on market, market hitting all-time highs on Bank Nifty.

Shares of Tata Motors climbed to a 52-week high in early trade on June 5, buoyed by the Tata Group's plans to invest Rs 13,000 crore to set-up a lithium-ion manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

At 09.58 am, shares of Tata Motors were trading at Rs 539.80, with gains of around 1 percent on the National Stock Exchange. The stock also touched a 52-week high of Rs 542.50 within the first hour of trade on June 5.

The Tata Group, through its subsidiary, Agratas Energy Storage Solution, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Gujarat for its capital expenditure plans in the state. The move will significantly support the development of the electric-vehicle (EV) industry in India.

According to an official announcement by the Gujarat government, the project is set to commence with an initial investment of Rs 13,000 crores (equivalent to USD 1.8 billion) during its first phase. This endeavour aims to establish a factory with a substantial capacity of 20 gigawatts (GW), furthering the government's push towards achieving 100 percent EV adoption and reduction in carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030.

The firm believes this move will provide a stable, secure and cost-effective supply chain for Tata Motors which will be critical for the company in maintaining its dominance in the Indian EV space.

Currently, Tata Motors holds the largest market share within the EV passenger car segment. With just two models, namely the Nexon EV and Tigor EV, Tata Motors commands an 86 percent market share in the EV sector.

Meanwhile, Tata Motors also expects to see some moderation in growth within the passenger vehicle segment to 5-7 percent in FY24. At such a time, the company's efforts to sustain long-term growth through their focus on sustainable products from the EV and CNG segments was cheered by the Street.

169	TECHM	Tech Mahindra Ltd	Infosys CEO Salil Parekh’s salary falls 21% to Rs 56.44 crore in FY23	"Infosys CEO & MD Salil Parekh

Infosys Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh’s FY23 compensation stood at Rs 56.44 crore, down from Rs 71 crore in the previous year, the Bengaluru-based IT services company’s annual report shows.

The fall is primarily because Parekh exercised fewer restricted stock units (RSUs) during the year. Restricted stock units is a form of equity compensation offered to employees. Infosys offers RSUs based on two plans. Under its 2015 plan, the stocks are vested largely based on time but under the 2019 plan, the benefit is based on performance. The performance indicators include total shareholder return and the company’s operating metrics.

Infosys’ cross-town rival Wipro’s CEO Thierry Delaporte drew Rs 82.4 crore during the year, a fall of 5 percent from the financial year 2021-22.

Parekh’s remuneration comprises fixed pay, variable pay, retiral benefits and the perquisite value of stock incentives exercised during the period. Infosys said that Parekh’s remuneration dropped 21 percent from the previous year.

How it stacks up

Of the Rs 56.44 crore compensation, Infosys said Parekh earned Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. Last fiscal, Parekh earned Rs 52.33 crore by exercising his RSUs, making him one of India’s highest-paid CEOs.

In FY23 fiscal, Parekh earned Rs 6.67 crore in base pay, Rs 45 lakh as retiral benefits and Rs 18.73 crore was his variable pay or bonus for the year. His variable pay went up from Rs 12.62 crore in 2022 to Rs 18.73 crore in 2023.

Parekh made 627 times the median remuneration —Rs 9 lakh — of the company’s employees. While the gap was narrower from the previous year but it came in a year characterised by fresher onboarding delays, variable pay cuts and more as the industry faced increased uncertainty.

Parekh, however, wasn’t the highest paid at Infosys. It was president Mohit Joshi, who resigned in March after being named Tech Mahindra CEO. Joshi earned Rs 57.32 crore in FY23. He leaves Infosys on June 9.

In his letter to shareholders, Parekh said FY23 was a strong year for the company’s business, with a growth of over 15 percent and operating margins at $2.5 billion.

“Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders – US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading company among our peers in total shareholder return over the past five years,” he said.

Parekh added that in the last few quarters, the global economy had been dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, and changes in demand environment for companies in various industries.

“Our strength in digital, cloud, and in automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in the evolving economic environment,” he said.

Disruptions ahead

Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani did not draw any remuneration for the year.

In his letter to shareholders, co-founder Nilekani wrote that the one overriding theme defining the world was that was “suffused with uncertainty”.

“The placid and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted models we have constructed of the world around us.

“The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without warning, is what’s before us. In any week, we may oscillate from caution to optimism and back to caution based on the news of the day.” Nilekani said.

These times required companies to be efficient as well as flexible, he added."

Sharekhan's research report on Torrent Pharmaceuticals

Torrent Pharma posted mixed results for Q4FY23, as while it outperformed on the sales front due to stronger growth in India, Brazil and Germany markets than anticipated it underperformed on net income basis due to lower other income and higher interest costs than anticipated. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth across markets; partially offset by the weakness in the US market. The existing base business in the US is witnessing decline due to huge price erosions without additional product launches.



Outlook

Hence, we downgrade the stock to HOLD as all the potential margin expansion and strong revenue growth prospects are already factored in, in the prices. The stock is currently trading at ~34.0x/29.2x its FY24E and FY25E EPS, which is at a premium to the historical multiples it has traded at.

174	TORNTPHARM	Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd	Torrent Pharma shares halt 5-day climb, slip 4% today; should you buy, sell or hold?	"Shares of Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd on Thursday settled 3.75 per cent lower at Rs 1,775.15, halting their five-day winning run. The stock witnessed a sharp upmove in the previous session and touched a one-year high of Rs 1,886.25 (intraday) after posting strong fourth-quarter results (Q4 FY23). Two domestic brokerages have assigned their respective 'Buy' ratings on the counter with a one-year target price of up to Rs 1,995.

AnandRathi said, ""Driven by healthy growth in its branded generics business for India, Brazil and RoW (up 23 per cent), Torrent's Q4 revenue grew 17 per cent, year-on-year (YoY), to Rs 2,490 crore. The EBITDA margin was steady, quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 29.20 per cent. Higher finance costs and lower other income pulled PAT (profit after tax ) down 11 per cent YoY to Rs 290 crore. We retain our 'Buy' rating on the stock, at a higher 12-month target price of Rs 1,995, 19x FY25e EV/EBITDA.""

Strong growth in domestic chronic therapies, launches and price hikes in India, Brazil and RoW would drive 24 per cent earnings growth in FY23-25, it added.

On the other hand, the brokerage cited pricing in the domestic portfolio, currency fluctuations and regulatory issues at plants as risks.

Prabhudas Lilladher said, ""Q4 FY23 EBITDA was largely in line, however, PAT was below our estimate led by higher tax and a one-time inventory write-off. Torrent has Rs 7,000 crore (75 per cent of total sales) worth of highly profitable branded formulation sales spread across India, Brazil and RoW markets. In the near term, Curatio acquisition will increase the company's net debt and we see this acquisition as EPS dilutive. Also, historically the company has successfully managed to integrate Unichem and Elder acquisition which gives us comfort. Maintain 'Buy' rating with a revised target price of Rs 1,900 per share (Rs 1,820 earlier), 17x EV/EBITDA to FY25E.""

The pharma company's base business grew 15 per cent and it expects India's business to continue its current growth momentum backed by new launches and integration of Curatio, Prabhudas further stated.

On the technical setup, the counter largely looked 'overbought'.

AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades said, ""Torrent Pharma is bullish but also overbought on the daily charts with next resistance at Rs 1,909. Investors should book profits at current levels and a close below Daily support of Rs 1,733 could lead to a target of Rs 1,515 in the near term.""

VLA Ambala, Research Analyst at Stock Market Today, said, ""The stock's major support is at Rs 1,440 and the expected target is a near term to mid-terms are between Rs 1,900 and Rs 2,100. Currently, it looked overbought. So, it is better to wait for prices to come down a little before initiating any fresh long positions.""

Motilal Oswal's research report on Torrent Pharma

Torrent Pharma’s (TRP) 4QFY23 operational performance was marginally below our expectations due to higher opex. TRP continues to outperform the industry in the branded generics segment, with revenue growth of 12.6% YoY in FY23 and EBITDA margin gain of 130bp YoY for the segment. We trim our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 4%/1% to factor in 1) incremental expenses for the consumer healthcare platform, 2) a gradual revival in US sales, and 3) improved growth momentum in the LATAM business. We value TRP at 26x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a TP of INR1650. The company continues to focus on the branded generics business in its key markets of India/Brazil. The strategy of building a consumer healthcare segment in India would further enhance volume growth potential for certain established brands. While a successful resolution of compliance issues is vital for growth in US generics, it has outsourced certain products, which would aid growth in US generics to some extent. Having said this, the current valuation adequately captures the upside in earnings. Maintain Neutral.



Outlook

175	TVSMOTOR	TVS Motor Company Ltd	F&O Strategy: Bull call spread on TVS Motor	"The stock of TVS Motor Company (₹1,305.55) is cruising well on the bull path. The outlook remains positive and if the current trend sustains, the stock could reach ₹1,385. TVS Motor finds immediate support at ₹1,234. Subsequent support is at ₹1,000 and only a close below this level will change the short-term outlook to negative. The long-term positive outlook will be negated only on a close below ₹870.

F&O pointers: TVS Motor June futures closed at ₹1,296.80, at discount to the spot price of ₹1305.55. This is mainly because of closing of long positions by traders to book profits, as the rally was quick. Option trading indicates a movement between ₹1,200 and ₹1,400.

Also read: F&O Tracker: Nifty futures witness short covering and long build-up seen in Bank Nifty futures

These options closed with a premium of ₹21.65 and ₹29.75 respectively. Thus, the net outgo (market lot 700 shares) is ₹8.10 or ₹5,670, which will be the maximum loss one can suffer.

175	TVSMOTOR	TVS Motor Company Ltd	Wedding season, pre-buy of EVs drive domestic two-wheeler demand	"Representative Image

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

The month of May was a mixed bag for the automotive sector. While demand for two-wheelers exceeded expectations due to the wedding season and pre-buying of electric vehicles (EVs), commercial vehicle (CV) demand fell short.

""The growth in domestic two-wheeler volumes increased approximately 10 percent year-on-year, driven by the pre-buying of electric two-wheelers ahead of the moderation of FAME II incentives starting on June 1, 2023, as well as the wedding season,"" said Kotak Institutional analysts in a report.

The two-wheeler export segment witnessed gradual recovery in volumes on a sequential basis, though overall numbers remained weak. On an aggregate basis, volumes increased 7 percent year on year (YoY) for Hero MotoCorp, 9 percent for TVS Motor and 22 percent for Royal Enfield.

Passenger vehicles

The wholesale volumes for the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) industry increased by 13-15 percent compared to the previous year. However, the retail volume growth remained minimal, only growing in low single digits year-on-year, as per KIE analysts.

Maruti Suzuki saw a 10 percent year-on-year increase in total volumes, driven by a 13 percent increase in domestic segment volumes. However, this growth was offset by a 3 percent decline in exports. Hyundai Motors reported a 15 percent year-on-year increase in volumes, while Kia Motors saw flat domestic volume growth year-on-year.

Commercial vehicles

The commercial vehicle segment's demand remained muted compared to the previous year, with volumes declining by mid to high-single digits.

This can be attributed to subdued demand trends as customers made pre-purchases of vehicles before the transition to BS-VI Phase II in March 2023, said analysts.

Tata Motors' CV volumes saw a 12 percent year-on-year decline and Ashok Leyland reported a 1 percent decline.

As per estimates, domestic tractor industry volumes also declined by low single digit on a yearly basis, with M&M reporting 5 percent YoY decline.

180	VEDL	Vedanta Ltd	Vedanta’s Rs 2,632-crore brand fee helps VRL repay part of its debt	"

Vedanta paid a brand fee of Rs 2,632 crore ($325 million) for 2022-23 (FY23), according to Nomura report. This was after the Anil Agarwal-owned holding company raised the brand fee to 2 per cent of the turnover for its Indian businesses in 2021. An increased brand fee paid by India-listed Vedanta, apart from record dividend, has helped Vedanta Resources (VRL) — the London-based holding company of Vedanta Group — to repay part of its debt.



In 2017, Vedanta signed a three-year brand licence agreement with VRL for the use of the brand ‘Vedanta’ which stipulated a brand fee to VRL at 0.75 per cent of the turnover of Vedanta. In 2021-22 (FY22), Vedanta and its subsidiaries paid a brand fee of Rs 1,553 crore, compared with Rs 939 crore of the brand fee paid in 2020-21 (FY21).



In FY21, the agreement was renewed and certain additional services were also agreed to be provided by VRL. After the new agreement, the brand and strategic service fee was renegotiated at 2 per cent of the turnover, while for the remaining subsidiaries, the previous rates remained unchanged. Later, certain subsidiaries of Vedanta executed similar agreements with VRL to pay brand fees ranging between 0.75 per cent and 1.5 per cent of their respective turnover.

Vedanta pays such fees in advance, at the beginning of the year based on estimated annual turnover, the company had said in its annual report last year. In FY22, the agreement was extended for 15 years.







Vedanta is not the only company to raise brand and royalty fees from its Indian subsidiaries. An email sent to Vedanta did not elicit any response until the time of going to press.

Effective February this year, Unilever Plc’s Indian subsidiary Hindustan Unilever raised royalty and central services fees to 3.45 per cent of turnover from 2.65 per cent — staggered over the next three years.



Analysts said the record dividend paid by the Indian subsidiaries and the rising brand fee has helped VRL repay its debt. Tata Group holding company, Tata Sons, also charges 0.25 per cent of the annual net income or 5 per cent of the profit before tax (whichever is less) for the use of the ‘Tata’ brand name by its subsidiaries. The year a company makes losses, Tata Group companies are not required to pay the fee.



VRL aims at reducing debt further in 2023-24 and ultimately have it at zero. Since March 31 this year, VRL has reduced its gross debt by $1.4 billion to $6.4 billion, compared with $7.8 billion at the end of March this year.



VRL owns a 68.1 per cent stake in Vedanta, which, in turn, holds a 63 per cent stake in Hindustan Zinc. In FY23, VRL received Rs 25,636 crore of dividends from Vedanta, which was partly used to repay debt, said analysts.

VRL also took fresh loans from Glencore, Trafigura, and other lenders, including JPMorgan Chase and Oaktree, to refinance its old loans.

State Bank of India | Hold | Resistance: Rs 560-565

The PSU Bank index has been consistent outperformer. But, after a multi week up move, select PSU banking stocks have witnessed profit taking. For State Bank of India, the overall structure remains positive. But the choppy trading in SBI this week and the inability to hold current levels could attract mild throwback till Rs 560-565 zone.



DLF | Hold | Resistance: Rs 505 | Support: Rs 455

Retaining a series of ascending tops and bottoms, DLF has been gradually trending higher. After a multi-week up move, the stock is likely to face minor consolidation with the immediate support placed near Rs 455 level. Eventually, the stock is likely to resume its upward trajectory and a level of Rs 505 looks achievable.



Ultratech Cement | Buy | Target Price: Rs 8,200 | Stop Loss: Rs 7,500

After taking a pause in the previous month, Ultratech Cement has resumed its gradual up-move. Amid a series of ascending tops and bottoms, important support is placed near Rs 7,500. A sustenance above Rs 7,750 would mean that the stock has more room on upside. In that case, a further up move till Rs 8,200 would be possible.

183	UNIONBANK	Union Bank of India Ltd	Special Benefits for Super Senior Citizens: Higher Interest Rates and More on Fixed Deposits	"In sync with the wealth of experience and wisdom that accompanies their years, super senior citizens, i.e., those 80 years and above, can look forward to preferential interest rate on bank fixed deposits in select banks. Besides, they may also enjoy liquidity in the form of overdraft facility, waiver on premature penalty charges, and other facilities. Here is a lowdown.

What’s on offer

RBL Bank, Union Bank of India, PNB and Indian Bank offer higher interest rates on FDs opened by super senior citizens.

RBL Bank’s Super Senior Citizen fixed deposits offer preferential interest rate of 75 bps (basis points) p.a. for all tenures (7 days to 20 years).

Likewise, Union Bank of India offers additional rate component to resident super senior citizens on term deposits up to ₹5 crore in all of its domestic term deposits scheme. The additional rate component applicable to resident super senior citizens is 75 bps over and above the normal rate displayed above (25 bps over and above rate applicable to resident senior citizen).

PNB offers super senior citizens an additional rate of interest of 80 bps over applicable card rate across all maturity buckets. In case of staff members as well as retired staff members who are also super senior citizens, maximum rate of interest to be allowed over applicable card rate is 180 bps over applicable card rate across all maturity buckets.

In case of Indian Bank, there are two ways in which super senior citizens can get extra interest. One, special deposit scheme ‘IND Super 400 Days’, which has been extended till June 30, 2023, offers super seniors 8 per cent (75 bps over public rates and 25 bps over senior citizen rates). Two, ‘IB – Golden Ager’ special term deposit account for super senior citizen offers additional 25 bps higher rate of interest over and above the additional rate that is presently being offered for normal senior citizen on term deposit for all deposit buckets. The minimum tenure is 7 days and maximum is 10 years.

On a different note, Central Bank of India offers ‘Cent Super Non-Callable Time Deposit for 444 days’ scheme where super seniors can get 100 bps and ex-staff super seniors can get 200 bps more interest, according to their website. While premature withdrawal is allowed, it will attract penalty of 2.5 per cent on the applicable rate of interest for running period of the time.

Paperwork involved

To be eligible for schemes for super senior citizens (age 80 years or above), one has to show age proof as on the date of opening of account. Any valid KYC document containing age/date of birth as per existing KYC policy of RBI can be accepted as proof of age. Birth certificate or any other valid proof containing age/date of birth can also be accepted as proof of age by banks.

The higher rate for super seniors is typically on domestic term deposits below a certain level (₹2 crore/10 crore) depending on the bank. Typically, super senior citizen rates are not applicable on non-resident deposits (NRE/NRO), though some special schemes may allow non-residents. Super senior FDs can be opened through online/offline mode.

Some banks allow super senior citizens to take advantage of special deposit schemes if account is self-only operated (no joint account allowed). This could prove to be problematic if the super senior suffers from health issues now or in future, and is not able to operate the account on his/her own.

While banks such as RBL may not charge premature withdrawal penalty, ‘IB - Golden Ager’, according to their website, levies charges as applicable to normal deposits if there is premature closure. Such charges could shave away the incremental return on special schemes if there is premature closure. Hence, super seniors should only park deposits in these schemes that in ordinary course of business wouldn’t be needed.

Super seniors may get liquidity with Overdraft (OD) facility upto 90 per cent of the principal value on super senior citizen FDs. But do look at the rate of interest on the OD. A rate of 2 per cent over the interest paid on deposit could be charged for OD.

Super seniors should note that in case any ongoing special deposit scheme for them is discontinued, the deposits maturing thereafter placed under the special product could automatically be rolled over to general senior citizen product under the respective maturity bucket."

In an exclusive interview with ET , he said he had been appointed with the mandate to “transform and take tough decisions”.Some key takeaways:: “By the end of the term, the company (will be) stronger, not only delivering good numbers in terms of growth and profitability, but (it will) also (be a) company that is playing a different role in front of clients. My obsession is with the way we are serving our clients. Our primary mission is to deliver excellent services for our clients.”“It’s difficult for me to speak for the board. But I can tell you one thing, I could not have a better board. Because (it) is supporting us. They are very aware of what we are doing. Every quarter they meet a lot of our leaders and they engage. They are contributing to our progression.”“The performance of the company has been solid in terms of growth. In terms of profitability, we've had a dip four quarters ago but I think the performance on our margins is solid, keeping in mind the acquisitions we've made. Some people may have decided not to do the acquisition for short-term margins but that would have been a mistake.”Beleaguered edtech startup Byju’s plans to launch the initial public offering (IPO) of its test-prep subsidiary Aakash Education Services in mid-2024. In a statement on Monday, the company said its board had cleared the IPO proposal. This comes at a time when the edtech startup is struggling to repay its $1.2 billion loan.The company said the appointment of the merchant bankers for the IPO will be announced soon. “The upcoming IPO will provide a significant capital infusion to bolster Aakash's infrastructure, broaden its reach, and extend high-quality test-prep education to a larger number of students across the nation,” it said. ET had reported on May 13 that Byju’s has closed a Rs 2,000-crore round from Davidson Kempner Capital in a structured credit transaction against the cash flows of Aakash Educational Services, linked to the test-prep arm’s public listing.The announcement on the IPO came on the day the Tiger Global- and Sequoia Capital-backed edtech company reportedly faces a deadline to repay quarterly interest of $40 million on a $1.2 billion loan it raised in November 2021.Last week, Bloomberg reported that Byju’s lenders pulled out of discussions to restructure the deal.Asia stands out as the largest market for mobile games, suggests a report titled Mobile Games Index from Statista and Adjoe, an advertising and monetisation platform.The report notes that the mobile games market in Asia generated $121.7 billion in revenue in 2022, and is estimated to grow to $185.9 billion by 2027.North America and Europe come second and third generating revenue of $75 billion and $22.6 billion, respectively, in 2022.

Many from India at the same time also bid goodbye to the messenger app Telegram . But how are the two related?Earlier this year, Disney+ Hotstar did not renew its deal with HBO. So, when the final season of Succession began streaming, there was no legitimate streaming platform for Indians. Enter Telegram.Many fans resorted to installing Telegram for the first time to access pirated episodes of the series through the app's user-led channels.“I did not do a single textual interaction on the app. Every Monday morning, I would ask a friend for the new episode on WhatsApp and they would send a link on Telegram,” said a Mumbai-based content writer. “Once the season was over, I uninstalled the app because WhatsApp is enough for all my instant messaging needs.”While SimilarWeb data accessed by ET showed that Telegram registered 21.1 million user visits in April, its highest since October 2022, digital media professionals emphasised the spike cannot be directly attributed to Succession, but that demand for the show could have been one of the many contributing factors.Users in India can now watch HBO shows, including Succession, on JioCinema.Today’s ETtech Top 5 newsletter was curated by Gaurab Dasgupta in New Delhi.

Some of the banks that the company allegedly cheated include Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India, State Bank of India, Axis Bank and Yes Bank, among others, reported NDTV on Friday.

IL&FS Transportation Network is a subsidiary of IL&FS Ltd, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018.

In its FIR, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Mumbai-based ITNL and its directors Karunakaran Ramchand, Deepak Das Gupta, Mukund Gajanan Sapre and then chief financial officer (CFO) Dilip Lalchand Bhatia for alleged criminal conspiracy and cheating as well as under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The agency recently conducted searches in Delhi, Gurugram and Mumbai at the premises of the accused persons, the officials said.

It is alleged that the accused entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat 19 banks under multiple banking arrangements (the Canara Bank being the largest lender).

The loan account was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) in 2018 and subsequently, categorised as ''fraud'' in 2021.

In its complaint to the CBI, which became the basis for the FIR, the Canara Bank has alleged that the accused misappropriated the sanctioned credit facilities through cheating, diversion of funds, circular transactions between related and sister concerns and misrepresentation of books of income and expenditures.

The bank in its complaint claimed that ITNL, a subsidiary of IL&FS, is the largest 'Built, Operate and Transfer' road asset owner in India and a market leader in the transport infrastructure sector having its presence in metro rail, city bus service and border check posts.

''For the said business, ITNL had availed various credit facilities under multipte banking arrangements. Canara Bank, being the largest lender, sanctioned a Term Loan of Rs 500 crore under Rupee Term Loan and External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) of USD 75 million (USD 25 million from Canara Bank, London Branch and USD 50 million from e-Syndicate Bank, London branch) to the borrower company,'' the complaint from Canara Bank alleged. The bank claimed that the account started to become irregular and was subsequently put under forensic audit. The audit found that quarterly foreign exposures were not disclosed in the minutes of ITNL for Board of Directors for FY 2015-16 and 2017-18. It showed potential violation of insider trading policy by one of the key managerial persons wherein it appears that one of them to be obtaining clearance for selling shares of ITNL, the bank alleged.

The audit also red-flagged potential diversion of funds, issues like taking fake and dummy competitive quotes from the sub-contractors, fake expenses on procurement of steel from a vendor which is registered as trader of tyres, among others. The CBI has alleged that the accused caused a wrongful loss, amounting to Rs 6,524 crore, to the consortium and wrongfully enriched themselves.

They brought in users with attractive discounts ranging from 50% to 60% at a wide array of restaurants. These efforts led to a more than 50% spike in the IPL 2020 season. However, in the 2023 IPL season, there was a noticeable change in approach,” said Kushal Bhatnagar, associate partner, Redseer Strategy Consultants.ET reported on March 26, that many consumer internet companies and startups, which had been heavy advertisers and sponsors during the IPL over the last few years, such as Byju's, Unacademy, PhonePe, and Amazon Prime, among others , were planning to stay away from this year’s edition in the backdrop of a funding crunch.Food-delivery platforms integrated their offerings with over-the-top (OTT) platforms and created customised advertisements for maximum impact during the previous seasons, contributing to the uptick in business.For IPL 2023 , Viacom18's JioCinema was the digital broadcaster of the tournament.

"Shares of Zomato surged sharply on Friday as the stock surged 8 per cent during the early trading session on the back of positive news flow over the revision of incentives and discounts at ONDC. The stock is less than 4 per cent shy of its issue price at Rs 76.



The government-backed ONDC is making revisions to its incentive structure. Under the new regime, the maximum pricing incentive will be capped at Rs 100 per order, which was Rs 120 per order earlier. Also, the total incentive will not exceed 50 per cent of the total order value, including the shipping charges.



Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has revised its incentive scheme for network participants to reduce the dependency on discounts for adoption, largely putting to rest questions around the network's potential to end the duopoly of Zomato and Swiggy.



Shares of Zomato surged about 8 per cent to Rs 73.20 on Friday, following the news development. However, the stock was seen at Rs 72.25 at 9.40 am with a market capitalization of little more than Rs 62,000 crore. The scrip had settled at Rs 67.92 on Thursday.



For the eligibility to avail the incentives, the minimum order value should be around Rs 200 for the food and beverage segment, while Rs 300 for all other categories including shipping charges. Furthermore, a buyer is eligible for an incentive for a maximum of five transactions per month.

Shares of Zomato have gained more than 80 per cent from its 52-week lows at Rs 40.55 on July 27, 2022. It is up 20 per cent in the year 2023 so far, while its performance in the last one year is flat. The stock has gained more than 15 per cent in the last one year.



Zomato reported trimming of losses - both on a year-on-year (YoY) and sequential basis - in the March quarter. The company’s consolidated net loss narrowed to Rs 188 crore from Rs 360 crore a year ago and Rs 345 crore a quarter ago. Consolidated revenue for Zomato increased a whopping 70 per cent YoY to Rs 2,056 crore, but missed estimates.



Christopher Wood, the stock guru and the Global Head of Equity Strategy of Jefferies has added Zomato for his India long-only portfolio, with a 4 per cent weightage. Zomato has also been added to the global long-only equity portfolio in the May edition of Wood's 'Greed & Fear’ index.



""The core business milestone was achieved mainly on the back of solid expansion in the food delivery contribution margin to 5.8 per cent vs 5.1 per cent in Q3. This was because profitability levers such as improvement in restaurant commissions and income, and lower discounts/variable cost offset the adverse impact of Gold launch,” JM Financial said with a 'buy' tag and target of Rs 105.



Management guides for positive adjusted EBITDA and PAT on a consolidated basis within the next four quarters, and plans to achieve this via profit growth in the FD business; loss reduction in Blinkit. The superior Q4 performance bolsters our belief in Zomato’s ability to execute & deliver profitable growth, said Emkay Global with a 'buy' rating and a target price of Rs 90.



""We note a sustained improvement in profitability of the food delivery business and meaningful reduction in losses in the hyperpure and quick commerce businesses.

194	NYKAA	Fsn E-Commerce Ventures Ltd	Spotting multibaggers: KPIT Tech, Nykaa shares among 35 midcaps that Goldman Sachs sees as potential winners	"Foreign brokerage Goldman Sachs sees KPIT Technologies, Devyani International, FSN E-Commerce Ventures (Nykaa), Bharat Dynamics, Kajaria Ceramics and Bharat Forge among 35 stocks in its India Midcap multibagger list, which satisfy at least four of six traits that it identified with multibaggers of the past. Others included Jubilant Foodworks, Oberoi Realty, Syngene International, JK Cement, Bata India, Kansai Nerolac and VIP Industries, among others.

The basket of 35 stocks generated 18 per cent return on equity (ROE) and is projected to log sales growth of 20 per cent and earning growth of 38 per cent CAGR over the next 3 years. Goldman Sachs said its basket outperformed Nifty by 18 percentage points and BSE200 by 15 percentage points since 2020.

The foreign brokerage said its study on 10 major markets across emerging and developed markets, covering 6,700 stocks and 10-baggers suggested that more than half (54 per cent) of the NSE 500 (269 stocks) generated 10-bagger returns, the largest proportion of multibaggers among the 10 markets. This is against 30 per cent for EMs and 20 per cent for developed markets. China (MSCI China) and Taiwan (TWSE) markets had only 18 per cent while US (S&P 500) and Japan (Topix) had 16 PER CENT stocks generating 10-bagger returns, one-third of the proportion of the stocks in India, Goldman Sachs noted.

""The 269 multibagger stocks all share a number of the following traits: 1) high realized growth rates; 2)

high capital return ratios; 3) mid/small-cap bias; 4) inexpensive starting valuations; 5) domestic sector orientation; and 6) high promoter holding,"" Goldman Sachs said.

Goldman Sachs all 269 historical multibagger stocks in India over the past two decades share at least one of the above 6 traits, and about 75 per cent of them share at least 4 traits.

Among the six factors, size, promoter holding, growth, and valuations have been comparatively more dominant factors, while sector and capital allocation appear to be less influential in identifying multibaggers, it noted.

""While India has historically offered superior multibagger peak returns (24x median total returns vs. 16 times for the overall 1500 multibagger stocks across 10 markets), we acknowledge that stocks don’t go up in a straight line and often investors are likely to face drawdowns on the road to multibagger returns, particularly given the small-mid cap dominance among multibagger stocks, which is usually associated with higher price volatility,"" it said.

Here's Goldman Sachs India Multibagger midcap basket:

Indian market, Goldman Sachs said, has outsized alpha opportunities. In addition to a strong track record of delivering long-term beta via a simple buy-and-hold index strategy, the equity market in India has offered outsized stock returns and alpha opportunities for EM investors, it said.

Over the past two decades, about 60 per cent of the current BSE 200 stocks would have outperformed the benchmark, it said adding that nearly 40 per cent of the current BSE 200 stocks have generated more than 20 per cent annualised returns over the past two decades, double the 20 per cent of stocks for broader MSCI EM.

""While the basket trades at expensive valuation of 32 times 2024 P/E, median forward PEG ratio appears reasonable at 2 times, it said.

195	POLICYBZR	PB Fintech Ltd	Paytm, Zomato, PB Fintech narrowed losses in Q4; are they set to deliver robust returns on D-St?	"Analysts on Dalal Street turned positive on new-age internet firms including One97 Communications (Paytm), Zomato and PB Fintech which managed to narrow down their losses substantially in the March quarter. Digital payments firm Paytm, which is down 67 per cent against its issue price, reported a loss of 168.40 crore in Q4FY23 against a loss of Rs 761.40 crore in the same quarter a year ago.

Brokerage ICICI Securities is positive on Paytm with a target price of Rs 1,055 mark, indicating an upside of 50 per cent against the market price of Rs 701.30 on May 30, 2023.

“Positive cycle of customer growth, retention and cross-sell playing out for the company is encouraging. Customer onboarding and an increase in use cases are helping growth,” ICICI Securities said in a report. Meanwhile, net sales of Paytm increased 51.50 per cent YoY to Rs 2334.50 crore during the quarter under review.

Likewise, PB Fintech, operator of insurance aggregator platform Policybazaar, reported a loss of Rs 8.95 crore for the quarter ended March 2023 against a loss of Rs 219.61 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The net loss of food delivery platform Zomato declined to Rs 188.20 crore in Q4FY23 over a loss of Rs 359.70 crore in Q4FY22.

Shares of PB Fintech and Zomato have lost around 38 per cent and 12 per cent against their respective issue prices so far. Shares of Paytm, PB Fintech and Zomato got listed on bourses during the second half of 2021. Net sales of PB Fintech and Zomato jumped nearly 61 per cent and 70 per cent YoY to Rs 869.09 crore and Rs 2056 crore, respectively, in Q4FY23.

Brokerage JM Financial is positive on Zomato with a target price of Rs 105. Shares of the company traded at Rs 66.83 on May 30. The target price shows a potential upside of 57 per cent in the food delivery firm’s shares.

“Zomato’s core business (ex-Blinkit) turned adjusted EBITDA positive in Q4FY23, at the front end of management’s guidance of achieving it by Q2FY24. The cherry on the cake was its commitment to turn both adjusted EBITDA and PAT positive on a consolidated level (including Blinkit) by Q4FY24. The core business milestone was achieved mainly on the back of solid expansion in the food delivery contribution margin to 5.8 per cent vs 5.1 per cent in Q3. This was because profitability levers such as improvement in restaurant commissions and income, and lower discounts/variable cost offset the adverse impact of Gold launch,” JM Financial said.

It further believes that management commitment to profitability improvement can lead to a significant upside from the current market price. Zomato is JM Financial’s top pick in the listed internet space due to its conviction in Zomato’s long-term growth prospects and the management’s strong execution capabilities.

JM Financial is also bullish on PB Fintech with a target price of Rs 980. Shares of the company traded at Rs 599.35 on May 30, 2023. “The company is now the most dominant insurance distributor in the country with our estimates suggesting Policybazaar accounting for around 42 per cent of online insurance distribution while also becoming the largest PoSP player. We have maintained our revenue forecasts for the company and brought forward PAT level profitability to FY24 itself, resulting in a DCF-based TP of INR 980. However, our steady state profitability remains similar and earlier margin improvement implies a slower uptick in the later years,” the brokerage said.
