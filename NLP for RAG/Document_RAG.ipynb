It offers a digital library of movies, TV shows, and original content for a monthly fee. Netflix revolutionized the home entertainment industry by utilizing the internet and providing convenient access to a wide selection of content.\n","What services does Netflix offer? \n"," Netflix offers a subscription-based service that provides access to a digital library of movies, television shows, and other original content. Additionally, Netflix used to offer a DVD-by-mail service, but it has shifted its focus to streaming services and video-on-demand (VOD).\n","What is Netflix's flat fee? \n"," Netflix's flat fee is a monthly subscription fee that subscribers pay to have access to its digital library of movies, television shows, and other original content.\n","Who is the Chief Executive Officer of Netflix? Give his brief introduction \n"," The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Netflix is Reed Hastings. He is the co-founder of Netflix and has been serving as the CEO since its inception. Hastings played a crucial role in the growth and success of Netflix, leading the company's expansion into the international market and overseeing the transition from DVD rentals to online streaming. Under his leadership, Netflix has become a dominant player in the streaming services industry, offering a wide range of original content and attracting millions of subscribers worldwide.\n","What were some of the regulatory restrictions Netflix faced in expanding its services internationally? \n"," Netflix faced regulatory restrictions in the countries it chose for expansion. For example, Indonesia's censorship agency claimed that much of Netflix's content was unsuitable for local audiences. Vietnamese regulators were also cautious on similar grounds, and Malaysia was likely to require that Netflix follow its censorship policy, largely due to religious reasons. China was very difficult to operate in due to strict regulations imposed on the country's media and entertainment industries. However, Netflix was still exploring possible ways to launch its services in China.\n","List all the challenges faced by Netflix out of America in different countries? \n"," The challenges faced by Netflix outside of America in different countries include regulatory restrictions imposed by governments, the need for local adaptation of content, competition from local service providers, underdeveloped infrastructure, competition from both home and host countries, financial costs including licensing fees and investment costs, and uncertainties and challenges in the global market environment.\n","How did Netflix's aggressive growth strategy come under criticism from industry analysts, and what were their concerns about the company's ability to provide area-specific, modified content to international subscribers? \n"," Industry analysts criticized Netflix's aggressive growth strategy because they believed that the company was outpacing its ability to provide area-specific, modified content to international subscribers. They pointed out that people in different countries have different preferences and are more reluctant to pay for a monthly subscription to a video service if the content is not tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, Netflix's limited availability in languages other than English put it at a disadvantage when competing with domestic content providers in each country. This resulted in severely limited content availability for international subscribers compared to American subscribers.\n","In which year did Digital TV Viewers and Movie viewers gap was highest? \n"," The gap between Digital TV Viewers and Movie viewers was highest in the year 2017.\n","What were the major financial costs associated with Netflix's international expansion? \n"," The major financial costs associated with Netflix's international expansion included investment costs, such as licensing and development expenses, as well as costs related to broadband and internet availability in each market. Additionally, Netflix incurred direct costs for partnerships with domestic content providers, marketing, distribution, and technology. The company also paid significant fees for global licensing deals to address restricted access to American content in regional licensing agreements. These high costs resulted in operating losses for Netflix's international business segment in the short term.\n","How much did Netflix offer to buy Blockbuster? \n"," Netflix offered to buy Blockbuster for $50 million.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Combine responses into a single string with new lines\n","all_responses = f\"{response1}\\n{response2}\\n{response3}\\n{response4}\\n{response5}\\n{response6}\\n{response7}\\n{response8}\\n{response9}\\n{response10}\"\n","\n","# Specify the file path where you want to save the text file\n","file_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/output_file.txt\"\n","\n","# Write the combined responses to the text file\n","with open(file_path, \"w\") as file:\n","    file.write(all_responses)\n","\n","# Display a success message\n","print(f\"All responses have been saved to: {file_path}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"p8Pzhtzx6gAB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700316271063,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Deepti Gupta","userId":"07823978843254387189"}},"outputId":"d34c1c6c-8f63-41de-ac6e-6f4c82dd422d"},"id":"p8Pzhtzx6gAB","execution_count":55,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["All responses have been saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/output_file.txt\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Answering questions using gpt-4 model"],"metadata":{"id":"LCejghGfWe_F"},"id":"LCejghGfWe_F"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#LLM instance - Model GPT-4\n","llm_gpt = OpenAI(temperature=0,\n","             model=\"gpt-4\",\n","             max_tokens=500)\n","\n","service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm_gpt)"],"metadata":{"id":"ShizeI4Ulhmx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700316281368,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1152,"user":{"displayName":"Deepti Gupta","userId":"07823978843254387189"}}},"id":"ShizeI4Ulhmx","execution_count":56,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Dimensions of text-ada-embedding-002\n","d = 1536\n","faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)\n","\n","#Vector Store\n","vector_store = FaissVectorStore(faiss_index=faiss_index)\n","storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)\n","netflix_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(netflix, storage_context=storage_context)\n","\n","#Query Engine\n","netflix__engine_gpt = netflix_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=2)"],"metadata":{"id":"wwy79dZfkjpT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700316283270,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":428,"user":{"displayName":"Deepti Gupta","userId":"07823978843254387189"}}},"id":"wwy79dZfkjpT","execution_count":57,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Sample question\n","response = netflix__engine_gpt.query(\n","    \"What is the document about?\"\n",")\n","print(response)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xre3cWUO-bn3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700316287000,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2166,"user":{"displayName":"Deepti Gupta","userId":"07823978843254387189"}},"outputId":"0f868449-5205-4298-bc33-e192fe1d6c49"},"id":"xre3cWUO-bn3","execution_count":58,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The document is about Netflix's international expansion and its challenges and successes in the global market.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":59,"id":"55c67ff8-7a7f-4032-bef8-373f0c272fd2","metadata":{"tags":[],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"55c67ff8-7a7f-4032-bef8-373f0c272fd2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700316552830,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":265831,"user":{"displayName":"Deepti Gupta","userId":"07823978843254387189"}},"outputId":"d6ecf6c2-3662-4e48-83b8-3d19646549ab"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["What is Netflix give a brief answer? \n"," Netflix is a company that started as a DVD-mailing service and later transitioned to a subscription-based streaming service.
